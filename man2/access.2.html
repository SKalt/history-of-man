<A NAME="lbAB">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NAME</H2>

access - check real user's permissions for a file
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<PRE>
<B>#include &lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/unistd.h">unistd.h</A>&gt;</B>

<B>int access(const char *</B><I>pathname</I><B>, int </B><I>mode</I><B>);</B>
</PRE>

<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B>access</B>()

checks whether the calling process can access the file
<I>pathname</I>.

If
<I>pathname</I>

is a symbolic link, it is dereferenced.
<P>
The
<I>mode</I>

specifies the accessibility check(s) to be performed,
and is either the value
<B>F_OK</B>,


or a mask consisting of the bitwise OR of one or more of
<B>R_OK</B>, <B>W_OK</B>, and <B>X_OK</B>.

<B>F_OK</B>

tests for the existence of the file.
<B>R_OK</B>, <B>W_OK</B>, and <B>X_OK</B>

test whether the file exists and grants read, write, and
execute permissions, respectively.
<P>
The check is done using the calling process's
<I>real</I>

UID and GID, rather than the effective IDs as is done when
actually attempting an operation (e.g.,
<B><A HREF="../man2/open.2.html">open</A></B>(2))

on the file.
This allows set-user-ID programs to
easily determine the invoking user's authority.
<P>
If the calling process is privileged (i.e., its real UID is zero),
then an
<B>X_OK</B>

check is successful for a regular file if execute permission
is enabled for any of the file owner, group, or other.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

On success (all requested permissions granted), zero is returned.
On error (at least one bit in
<I>mode</I>

asked for a permission that is denied, or some other error occurred),
-1 is returned, and
<I>errno</I>

is set appropriately.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

<B>access</B>()

shall fail if:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EACCES</B>

<DD>
The requested access would be denied to the file, or search permission
is denied for one of the directories in the path prefix of
<I>pathname</I>.

(See also
<B><A HREF="../man7/path_resolution.7.html">path_resolution</A></B>(7).)

<DT><B>ELOOP</B>

<DD>
Too many symbolic links were encountered in resolving
<I>pathname</I>.

<DT><B>ENAMETOOLONG</B>

<DD>
<I>pathname</I>

is too long.
<DT><B>ENOENT</B>

<DD>
A component of
<I>pathname</I>

does not exist or is a dangling symbolic link.
<DT><B>ENOTDIR</B>

<DD>
A component used as a directory in
<I>pathname</I>

is not, in fact, a directory.
<DT><B>EROFS</B>

<DD>
Write permission was requested for a file on a read-only file system.
</DL>
<P>

<B>access</B>()

may fail if:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EFAULT</B>

<DD>
<I>pathname</I>

points outside your accessible address space.
<DT><B>EINVAL</B>

<DD>
<I>mode</I>

was incorrectly specified.
<DT><B>EIO</B>

<DD>
An I/O error occurred.
<DT><B>ENOMEM</B>

<DD>
Insufficient kernel memory was available.
<DT><B>ETXTBSY</B>

<DD>
Write access was requested to an executable which is being
executed.

<H2>CONFORMING TO</H2>

SVr4, 4.3BSD, POSIX.1-2001.
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NOTES</H2>

<P>

<B>Warning</B>:

Using
<B>access</B>()

to check if a user is authorized to, for example,
open a file before actually doing so using
<B><A HREF="../man2/open.2.html">open</A></B>(2)

creates a security hole, because the user might exploit the short time
interval between checking and opening the file to manipulate it.
<B>For this reason, the use of this system call should be avoided</B>.

(In the example just described,
a safer alternative would be to temporarily switch the process's
effective user ID to the real ID and then call
<B><A HREF="../man2/open.2.html">open</A></B>(2).)

<P>

<B>access</B>()

always dereferences symbolic links.
If you need to check the permissions on a symbolic link, use
<B><A HREF="../man2/faccessat.2.html">faccessat</A>(2)</B>

with the flag
<B>AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW</B>.

<P>

<B>access</B>()

returns an error if any of the access types in
<I>mode</I>

is denied, even if some of the other access types in
<I>mode</I>

are permitted.
<P>

If the calling process has appropriate privileges (i.e., is superuser),
POSIX.1-2001 permits an implementation to indicate success for an
<B>X_OK</B>

check even if none of the execute file permission bits are set.

Linux does not do this.
<P>

A file is only accessible if the permissions on each of the
directories in the path prefix of
<I>pathname</I>

grant search (i.e., execute) access.
If any directory is inaccessible, then the
<B>access</B>()

call will fail, regardless of the permissions on the file itself.
<P>

Only access bits are checked, not the file type or contents.
Therefore, if a directory is found to be writable,
it probably means that files can be created in the directory,
and not that the directory can be written as a file.
Similarly, a DOS file may be found to be &quot;executable,&quot; but the
<B><A HREF="../man2/execve.2.html">execve</A></B>(2)

call will still fail.
<P>

<B>access</B>()

may not work correctly on NFS file systems with UID mapping enabled,
because UID mapping is done on the server and hidden from the client,
which checks permissions.
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>BUGS</H2>

In kernel 2.4 (and earlier) there is some strangeness in the handling of
<B>X_OK</B>

tests for superuser.
If all categories of execute permission are disabled
for a nondirectory file, then the only
<B>access</B>()

test that returns -1 is when
<I>mode</I>

is specified as just
<B>X_OK</B>;

if
<B>R_OK</B>

or
<B>W_OK</B>

is also specified in
<I>mode</I>,

then
<B>access</B>()

returns 0 for such files.

Early 2.6 kernels (up to and including 2.6.3)
also behaved in the same way as kernel 2.4.
<P>
In kernels before 2.6.20,
<B>access</B>()

ignored the effect of the
<B>MS_NOEXEC</B>

flag if it was used to
<B><A HREF="../man2/mount.2.html">mount</A></B>(2)

the underlying file system.
Since kernel 2.6.20,
<B>access</B>()

honors this flag.
