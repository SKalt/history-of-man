<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

Linux uses David L. Mills' clock adjustment algorithm (see RFC&nbsp;5905).
The system call
<B>adjtimex</B>()

reads and optionally sets adjustment parameters for this algorithm.
It takes a pointer to a
<I>timex</I>

structure, updates kernel parameters from (selected) field values,
and returns the same structure updated with the current kernel values.
This structure is declared as follows:
<P>


<PRE>
struct timex {
    int  modes;      /* Mode selector */
    long offset;     /* Time offset; nanoseconds, if STA_NANO
                        status flag is set, otherwise
                        microseconds */
    long freq;       /* Frequency offset; see NOTES for units */
    long maxerror;   /* Maximum error (microseconds) */
    long esterror;   /* Estimated error (microseconds) */
    int  status;     /* Clock command/status */
    long constant;   /* PLL (phase-locked loop) time constant */
    long precision;  /* Clock precision
                        (microseconds, read-only) */
    long tolerance;  /* Clock frequency tolerance (read-only);
                        see NOTES for units */
    struct timeval time;
                     /* Current time (read-only, except for
                        ADJ_SETOFFSET); upon return, time.tv_usec
                        contains nanoseconds, if STA_NANO status
                        flag is set, otherwise microseconds */
    long tick;       /* Microseconds between clock ticks */
    long ppsfreq;    /* PPS (pulse per second) frequency
                        (read-only); see NOTES for units */
    long jitter;     /* PPS jitter (read-only); nanoseconds, if
                        STA_NANO status flag is set, otherwise
                        microseconds */
    int  shift;      /* PPS interval duration
                        (seconds, read-only) */
    long stabil;     /* PPS stability (read-only);

    long stbcnt;     /* PPS count of stability limit exceeded

    int tai;         /* TAI offset, as set by previous ADJ_TAI
                        operation (seconds, read-only,

<P>

The
<I>modes</I>

field determines which parameters, if any, to set.
(As described later in this page,
the constants used for
<B>ntp_adjtime</B>()

are equivalent but differently named.)
It is a bit mask containing a
bitwise-<I>or</I>

combination of zero or more of the following bits:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>ADJ_OFFSET</B>

<DD>
Set time offset from
<I>buf.offset</I>.

Since Linux 2.6.26,

the supplied value is clamped to the range (-0.5s, +0.5s).
In older kernels, an
<B>EINVAL</B>

error occurs if the supplied value is out of range.
<DT><B>ADJ_FREQUENCY</B>

<DD>
Set frequency offset from
<I>buf.freq</I>.

Since Linux 2.6.26,

the supplied value is clamped to the range (-32768000, +32768000).
In older kernels, an
<B>EINVAL</B>

error occurs if the supplied value is out of range.
<DT><B>ADJ_MAXERROR</B>

<DD>
Set maximum time error from
<I>buf.maxerror</I>.

<DT><B>ADJ_ESTERROR</B>

<DD>
Set estimated time error from
<I>buf.esterror</I>.

<DT><B>ADJ_STATUS</B>

<DD>
Set clock status bits from
<I>buf.status</I>.

A description of these bits is provided below.
<DT><B>ADJ_TIMECONST</B>

<DD>
Set PLL time constant from
<I>buf.constant</I>.

If the
<B>STA_NANO</B>

status flag (see below) is clear, the kernel adds 4 to this value.
<DT><B>ADJ_SETOFFSET</B> (since Linux 2.6.39)

<DD>


Add
<I>buf.time</I>

to the current time.
If
<I>buf.status</I>

includes the
<B>ADJ_NANO</B>

flag, then
<I>buf.time.tv_usec</I>

is interpreted as a nanosecond value;
otherwise it is interpreted as microseconds.
<DT><B>ADJ_MICRO</B> (since Linux 2.6.26)

<DD>


Select microsecond resolution.
<DT><B>ADJ_NANO</B> (since Linux 2.6.26)

<DD>


Select nanosecond resolution.
Only one of
<B>ADJ_MICRO</B>

and
<B>ADJ_NANO</B>

should be specified.
<DT><B>ADJ_TAI</B> (since Linux 2.6.26)

<DD>

Set TAI (Atomic International Time) offset from
<I>buf.constant</I>.

<P>
<B>ADJ_TAI</B>

should not be used in conjunction with
<B>ADJ_TIMECONST</B>,

since the latter mode also employs the
<I>buf.constant</I>

field.
<P>
For a complete explanation of TAI
and the difference between TAI and UTC, see

<I>BIPM</I>


<DT><B>ADJ_TICK</B>

<DD>
Set tick value from
<I>buf.tick</I>.

</DL>
<P>

Alternatively,
<I>modes</I>

can be specified as either of the following (multibit mask) values,
in which case other bits should not be specified in
<I>modes</I>:



<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>ADJ_OFFSET_SINGLESHOT</B>

<DD>


Old-fashioned
<B>adjtime</B>():

(gradually) adjust time by value specified in
<I>buf.offset</I>,

which specifies an adjustment in microseconds.
<DT><B>ADJ_OFFSET_SS_READ</B> (functional since Linux 2.6.28)

<DD>



Return (in
<I>buf.offset</I>)

the remaining amount of time to be adjusted after an earlier
<B>ADJ_OFFSET_SINGLESHOT</B>

operation.
This feature was added in Linux 2.6.24,

but did not work correctly

until Linux 2.6.28.
</DL>
<P>

Ordinary users are restricted to a value of either 0 or
<B>ADJ_OFFSET_SS_READ</B>

for
<I>modes</I>.

Only the superuser may set any parameters.
<P>
The
<I>buf.status</I>

field is a bit mask that is used to set and/or retrieve status
bits associated with the NTP implementation.
Some bits in the mask are both readable and settable,
while others are read-only.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>STA_PLL</B> (read-write)

<DD>
Enable phase-locked loop (PLL) updates via
<B>ADJ_OFFSET</B>.

<DT><B>STA_PPSFREQ</B> (read-write)

<DD>
Enable PPS (pulse-per-second) frequency discipline.
<DT><B>STA_PPSTIME</B> (read-write)

<DD>
Enable PPS time discipline.
<DT><B>STA_FLL</B> (read-write)

<DD>
Select frequency-locked loop (FLL) mode.
<DT><B>STA_INS</B> (read-write)

<DD>
Insert a leap second after the last second of the UTC day,
thus extending the last minute of the day by one second.
Leap-second insertion will occur each day, so long as this flag remains set.












<DT><B>STA_DEL</B> (read-write)

<DD>
Delete a leap second at the last second of the UTC day.





Leap second deletion will occur each day, so long as this flag
remains set.


<DT><B>STA_UNSYNC</B> (read-write)

<DD>
Clock unsynchronized.
<DT><B>STA_FREQHOLD</B> (read-write)

<DD>
Hold frequency.

Normally adjustments made via
<B>ADJ_OFFSET</B>

result in dampened frequency adjustments also being made.
So a single call corrects the current offset,
but as offsets in the same direction are made repeatedly,
the small frequency adjustments will accumulate to fix the long-term skew.
<P>
This flag prevents the small frequency adjustment from being made
when correcting for an
<B>ADJ_OFFSET</B>

value.


<DT><B>STA_PPSSIGNAL</B> (read-only)

<DD>
A valid PPS (pulse-per-second) signal is present.
<DT><B>STA_PPSJITTER</B> (read-only)

<DD>
PPS signal jitter exceeded.
<DT><B>STA_PPSWANDER</B> (read-only)

<DD>
PPS signal wander exceeded.
<DT><B>STA_PPSERROR</B> (read-only)

<DD>
PPS signal calibration error.
<DT><B>STA_CLOCKERR</B> (read-only)

<DD>
Clock hardware fault.

<DT><B>STA_NANO</B> (read-only; since Linux 2.6.26)

<DD>


Resolution (0 = microsecond, 1 = nanoseconds).
Set via
<B>ADJ_NANO</B>,

cleared via
<B>ADJ_MICRO</B>.

<DT><B>STA_MODE</B> (since Linux 2.6.26)

<DD>


Mode (0 = Phase Locked Loop, 1 = Frequency Locked Loop).
<DT><B>STA_CLK</B> (read-only; since Linux 2.6.26)

<DD>


Clock source (0 = A, 1 = B); currently unused.
</DL>
<P>

Attempts to set read-only
<I>status</I>

bits are silently ignored.

<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>ntp_adjtime ()</H3>

The
<B>ntp_adjtime</B>()

library function
(described in the NTP &quot;Kernel Application Program API&quot;, KAPI)
is a more portable interface for performing the same task as
<B>adjtimex</B>().

Other than the following points, it is identical to
<B>adjtime</B>():

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
The constants used in
<I>modes</I>

are prefixed with &quot;MOD_&quot; rather than &quot;ADJ_&quot;, and have the same suffixes (thus,
<B>MOD_OFFSET</B>,

<B>MOD_FREQUENCY</B>,

and so on), other than the exceptions noted in the following points.
<DT>*<DD>
<B>MOD_CLKA</B>

is the synonym for
<B>ADJ_OFFSET_SINGLESHOT</B>.

<DT>*<DD>
<B>MOD_CLKB</B>

is the synonym for
<B>ADJ_TICK</B>.

<DT>*<DD>
The is no synonym for
<B>ADJ_OFFSET_SS_READ</B>,

which is not described in the KAPI.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

On success,
<B>adjtimex</B>()

and
<B>ntp_adjtime</B>()

return the clock state; that is, one of the following values:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>TIME_OK</B>

<DD>
Clock synchronized, no leap second adjustment pending.
<DT><B>TIME_INS</B>

<DD>
Indicates that a leap second will be added at the end of the UTC day.
<DT><B>TIME_DEL</B>

<DD>
Indicates that a leap second will be deleted at the end of the UTC day.
<DT><B>TIME_OOP</B>

<DD>
Insertion of a leap second is in progress.
<DT><B>TIME_WAIT</B>

<DD>
A leap-second insertion or deletion has been completed.
This value will be returned until the next
<B>ADJ_STATUS</B>

operation clears the
<B>STA_INS</B>

and
<B>STA_DEL</B>

flags.
<DT><B>TIME_ERROR</B>

<DD>
The system clock is not synchronized to a reliable server.
This value is returned when any of the following holds true:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
Either
<B>STA_UNSYNC</B>

or
<B>STA_CLOCKERR</B>

is set.
<DT>*<DD>
<B>STA_PPSSIGNAL</B>

is clear and either
<B>STA_PPSFREQ</B>

or
<B>STA_PPSTIME</B>

is set.
<DT>*<DD>
<B>STA_PPSTIME</B>

and
<B>STA_PPSJITTER</B>

are both set.
<DT>*<DD>
<B>STA_PPSFREQ</B>

is set and either
<B>STA_PPSWANDER</B>

or
<B>STA_PPSJITTER</B>

is set.
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
The symbolic name
<B>TIME_BAD</B>

is a synonym for
<B>TIME_ERROR</B>,

provided for backward compatibility.
</DL>
<P>

Note that starting with Linux 3.4,


the call operates asynchronously and the return value usually will
not reflect a state change caused by the call itself.
<P>

On failure, these calls return -1 and set
<I>errno</I>.

<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EFAULT</B>

<DD>
<I>buf</I>

does not point to writable memory.
<DT><B>EINVAL</B> (kernels before Linux 2.6.26)

<DD>
An attempt was made to set
<I>buf.freq</I>

to a value outside the range (-33554432, +33554432).


<DT><B>EINVAL</B> (kernels before Linux 2.6.26)

<DD>
An attempt was made to set
<I>buf.offset</I>

to a value outside the permitted range.
In kernels before Linux 2.0, the permitted range was (-131072, +131072).
From Linux 2.0 onwards, the permitted range was (-512000, +512000).
<DT><B>EINVAL</B>

<DD>
An attempt was made to set
<I>buf.status</I>

to a value other than those listed above.
<DT><B>EINVAL</B>

<DD>
An attempt was made to set
<I>buf.tick</I>

to a value outside the range
900000/<B>HZ</B>

to
1100000/<B>HZ</B>,

where
<B>HZ</B>

is the system timer interrupt frequency.
<DT><B>EPERM</B>

<DD>
<I>buf.modes</I>

is neither 0 nor
<B>ADJ_OFFSET_SS_READ</B>,

and the caller does not have sufficient privilege.
Under Linux, the
<B>CAP_SYS_TIME</B>

capability is required.

<H2>CONFORMING TO</H2>

Neither of these interfaces is described in POSIX.1
<P>
<B>adjtimex</B>()

is Linux-specific and should not be used in programs
intended to be portable.

<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NOTES</H2>

In struct
<I>timex</I>,

<I>freq</I>,

<I>ppsfreq</I>,

and
<I>stabil</I>

are ppm (parts per million) with a 16-bit fractional part,
which means that a value of 1 in one of those fields
actually means 2^-16 ppm, and 2^16=65536 is 1 ppm.
This is the case for both input values (in the case of
<I>freq</I>)

and output values.
<P>
The leap-second processing triggered by
<B>STA_INS</B>

and
<B>STA_DEL</B>

is done by the kernel in timer context
Thus, it will take one tick into the second
for the leap second to be inserted or deleted.
