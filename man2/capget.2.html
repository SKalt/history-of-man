<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

As of Linux 2.2,
the power of the superuser (root) has been partitioned into
a set of discrete capabilities.
Each thread has a set of effective capabilities identifying
which capabilities (if any) it may currently exercise.
Each thread also has a set of inheritable capabilities that may be
passed through an
<B><A HREF="../man2/execve.2.html">execve</A></B>(2)

call, and a set of permitted capabilities
that it can make effective or inheritable.
<P>

These two system calls are the raw kernel interface for getting and
setting thread capabilities.
Not only are these system calls specific to Linux,
but the kernel API is likely to change and use of
these system calls (in particular the format of the
<I>cap_user_*_t</I>

types) is subject to extension with each kernel revision,
but old programs will keep working.
<P>
The portable interfaces are
<B><A HREF="../man3/cap_set_proc.3.html">cap_set_proc</A></B>(3)

and
<B><A HREF="../man3/cap_get_proc.3.html">cap_get_proc</A></B>(3);

if possible, you should use those interfaces in applications.
If you wish to use the Linux extensions in applications, you should
use the easier-to-use interfaces
<B><A HREF="../man3/capsetp.3.html">capsetp</A></B>(3)

and
<B><A HREF="../man3/capgetp.3.html">capgetp</A></B>(3).

<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Current details</H3>

Now that you have been warned, some current kernel details.
The structures are defined as follows.
<P>
<PRE>
#define _LINUX_CAPABILITY_VERSION_1  0x19980330
#define _LINUX_CAPABILITY_U32S_1     1

#define _LINUX_CAPABILITY_VERSION_2  0x20071026
#define _LINUX_CAPABILITY_U32S_2     2

typedef struct __user_cap_header_struct {
   __u32 version;
   int pid;
} *cap_user_header_t;

typedef struct __user_cap_data_struct {
   __u32 effective;
   __u32 permitted;
   __u32 inheritable;
} *cap_user_data_t;
</PRE>


<P>
The
<I>effective</I>,

<I>permitted</I>,

and
<I>inheritable</I>

fields are bit masks of the capabilities defined in
<B><A HREF="../man7/capabilities.7.html">capabilities</A></B>(7).

Note the
<B>CAP_*</B>

values are bit indexes and need to be bit-shifted before ORing into
the bit fields.
To define the structures for passing to the system call you have to use the
<I>struct __user_cap_header_struct</I>

and
<I>struct __user_cap_data_struct</I>

names because the typedefs are only pointers.
<P>
Kernels prior to 2.6.25 prefer
32-bit capabilities with version
<B>_LINUX_CAPABILITY_VERSION_1</B>,

and kernels 2.6.25+ prefer 64-bit capabilities with version
<B>_LINUX_CAPABILITY_VERSION_2</B>.

Note, 64-bit capabilities use
<I>datap</I>[0]

and
<I>datap</I>[1],

whereas 32-bit capabilities use only
<I>datap</I>[0].

<P>
Another change affecting the behavior of these system calls is kernel
support for file capabilities (VFS capability support).
This support is currently a compile time option (added in kernel 2.6.24).
<P>
For
<B>capget</B>()

calls, one can probe the capabilities of any process by specifying its
process ID with the
<I>hdrp-&gt;pid</I>

field value.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>With VFS capability support</H3>

VFS Capability support creates a file-attribute method for adding
capabilities to privileged executables.
This privilege model obsoletes kernel support for one process
asynchronously setting the capabilities of another.
That is, with VFS support, for
<B>capset</B>()

calls the only permitted values for
<I>hdrp-&gt;pid</I>

are 0 or
<B><A HREF="../man2/getpid.2.html">getpid</A></B>(2),

which are equivalent.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Without VFS capability support</H3>

When the kernel does not support VFS capabilities,
<B>capset</B>()

calls can operate on the capabilities of the thread specified by the
<I>pid</I>

field of
<I>hdrp</I>

when that is nonzero, or on the capabilities of the calling thread if
<I>pid</I>

is 0.
If
<I>pid</I>

refers to a single-threaded process, then
<I>pid</I>

can be specified as a traditional process ID;
operating on a thread of a multithreaded process requires a thread ID
of the type returned by
<B><A HREF="../man2/gettid.2.html">gettid</A></B>(2).

For
<B>capset</B>(),

<I>pid</I>

can also be: -1, meaning perform the change on all threads except the
caller and
<B><A HREF="../man8/init.8.html">init</A></B>(8);

or a value less than -1, in which case the change is applied
to all members of the process group whose ID is -<I>pid</I>.
<P>
For details on the data, see
<B><A HREF="../man7/capabilities.7.html">capabilities</A></B>(7).

<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

On success, zero is returned.
On error, -1 is returned, and
<I>errno</I>

is set appropriately.
<P>
The calls will fail with the error
<B>EINVAL</B>,

and set the
<I>version</I>

field of
<I>hdrp</I>

to the kernel preferred value of
<B>_LINUX_CAPABILITY_VERSION_?</B>

when an unsupported
<I>version</I>

value is specified.
In this way, one can probe what the current
preferred capability revision is.
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EFAULT</B>

<DD>
Bad memory address.
<I>hdrp</I>

must not be NULL.
<I>datap</I>

may be NULL only when the user is trying to determine the preferred
capability version format supported by the kernel.
<DT><B>EINVAL</B>

<DD>
One of the arguments was invalid.
<DT><B>EPERM</B>

<DD>
An attempt was made to add a capability to the Permitted set, or to set
a capability in the Effective or Inheritable sets that is not in the
Permitted set.
<DT><B>EPERM</B>

<DD>
The caller attempted to use
<B>capset</B>()

to modify the capabilities of a thread other than itself,
but lacked sufficient privilege.
For kernels supporting VFS
capabilities, this is never permitted.
For kernels lacking VFS
support, the
<B>CAP_SETPCAP</B>

capability is required.
(A bug in kernels before 2.6.11 meant that this error could also
occur if a thread without this capability tried to change its
own capabilities by specifying the
<I>pid</I>

field as a nonzero value (i.e., the value returned by
<B><A HREF="../man2/getpid.2.html">getpid</A></B>(2))

instead of 0.)
<DT><B>ESRCH</B>

<DD>
No such thread.
