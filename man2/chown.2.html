<B>fchown</B>(),

<B>lchown</B>():

_BSD_SOURCE || _XOPEN_SOURCE&nbsp;&gt;=&nbsp;500
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

These system calls change the owner and group of a file.
The differ only in how the file is specified:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
<B>chown</B>()

changes the ownership of the file specified by
<I>path</I>,

which is dereferenced if it is a symbolic link.
<DT>*<DD>
<B>fchown</B>()

changes the ownership of the file referred to by the open file descriptor
<I>fd</I>.

<DT>*<DD>
<B>lchown</B>()

is like
<B>chown</B>(),

but does not dereference symbolic links.
</DL>
<P>

Only a privileged process (Linux: one with the
<B>CAP_CHOWN</B>

capability) may change the owner of a file.
The owner of a file may change the group of the file
to any group of which that owner is a member.
A privileged process (Linux: with
<B>CAP_CHOWN</B>)

may change the group arbitrarily.
<P>
If the
<I>owner</I>

or
<I>group</I>

is specified as -1, then that ID is not changed.
<P>
When the owner or group of an executable file are changed by a non-superuser,
the
<B>S_ISUID</B>

and
<B>S_ISGID</B>

mode bits are cleared.
POSIX does not specify whether
this also should happen when root does the
<B>chown</B>();

the Linux behavior depends on the kernel version.



In case of a non-group-executable file (i.e., one for which the
<B>S_IXGRP</B>

bit is not set) the
<B>S_ISGID</B>

bit indicates mandatory locking, and is not cleared by a
<B>chown</B>().

<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

On success, zero is returned.
On error, -1 is returned, and
<I>errno</I>

is set appropriately.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

Depending on the file system, other errors can be returned.
The more general errors for
<B>chown</B>()

are listed below.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EACCES</B>

<DD>
Search permission is denied on a component of the path prefix.
(See also
<B><A HREF="../man7/path_resolution.7.html">path_resolution</A></B>(7).)

<DT><B>EFAULT</B>

<DD>
<I>path</I>

points outside your accessible address space.
<DT><B>ELOOP</B>

<DD>
Too many symbolic links were encountered in resolving
<I>path</I>.

<DT><B>ENAMETOOLONG</B>

<DD>
<I>path</I>

is too long.
<DT><B>ENOENT</B>

<DD>
The file does not exist.
<DT><B>ENOMEM</B>

<DD>
Insufficient kernel memory was available.
<DT><B>ENOTDIR</B>

<DD>
A component of the path prefix is not a directory.
<DT><B>EPERM</B>

<DD>
The calling process did not have the required permissions
(see above) to change owner and/or group.
<DT><B>EROFS</B>

<DD>
The named file resides on a read-only file system.
</DL>
<P>

The general errors for
<B>fchown</B>()

are listed below:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EBADF</B>

<DD>
The descriptor is not valid.
<DT><B>EIO</B>

<DD>
A low-level I/O error occurred while modifying the inode.
<DT><B>ENOENT</B>

<DD>
See above.
<DT><B>EPERM</B>

<DD>
See above.
<DT><B>EROFS</B>

<DD>
See above.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>CONFORMING TO</H2>

4.4BSD, SVr4, POSIX.1-2001.
<P>
The 4.4BSD version can only be
used by the superuser (that is, ordinary users cannot give away files).






<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NOTES</H2>

When a new file is created (by, for example,
<B><A HREF="../man2/open.2.html">open</A></B>(2)

or
<B><A HREF="../man2/mkdir.2.html">mkdir</A></B>(2)),

its owner is made the same as the file system user ID of the
creating process.
The group of the file depends on a range of factors,
including the type of file system,
the options used to mount the file system,
and whether or not the set-group-ID permission bit is enabled
on the parent directory.
If the file system supports the
<I>-o&nbsp;grpid</I>

(or, synonymously
<I>-o&nbsp;bsdgroups</I>)

and
<I>-o&nbsp;nogrpid</I>

(or, synonymously
<I>-o&nbsp;sysvgroups</I>)

<B><A HREF="../man8/mount.8.html">mount</A></B>(8)

options, then the rules are as follows:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
If the file system is mounted with
<I>-o&nbsp;grpid</I>,

then the group of a new file is made
the same as that of the parent directory.
<DT>*<DD>
If the file system is mounted with
<I>-o&nbsp;nogrpid</I>

and the set-group-ID bit is disabled on the parent directory,
then the group of a new file is made the same as the
process's file system GID.
<DT>*<DD>
If the file system is mounted with
<I>-o&nbsp;nogrpid</I>

and the set-group-ID bit is enabled on the parent directory,
then the group of a new file is made
the same as that of the parent directory.
</DL>
<P>

As at Linux 2.6.25,
the
<I>-o&nbsp;grpid</I>

and
<I>-o&nbsp;nogrpid</I>

mount options are supported by ext2, ext3, ext4, and XFS.
File systems that don't support these mount options follow the
<I>-o&nbsp;nogrpid</I>

rules.
<P>

The
<B>chown</B>()

semantics are deliberately violated on NFS file systems
which have UID mapping enabled.
Additionally, the semantics of all system
calls which access the file contents are violated, because
<B>chown</B>()

may cause immediate access revocation on already open files.
Client side
caching may lead to a delay between the time where ownership have
been changed to allow access for a user and the time where the file can
actually be accessed by the user on other clients.
<P>
In versions of Linux prior to 2.1.81 (and distinct from 2.1.46),
<B>chown</B>()

did not follow symbolic links.
Since Linux 2.1.81,
<B>chown</B>()

does follow symbolic links, and there is a new system call
<B>lchown</B>()

that does not follow symbolic links.
Since Linux 2.1.86, this new call (that has the same semantics
as the old
<B>chown</B>())

has got the same syscall number, and
<B>chown</B>()

got the newly introduced number.
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>EXAMPLE</H2>

<P>

The following program changes the ownership of the file named in
its second command-line argument to the value specified in its
first command-line argument.
The new owner can be specified either as a numeric user ID,
or as a username (which is converted to a user ID by using
<B><A HREF="../man3/getpwnam.3.html">getpwnam</A></B>(3)

to perform a lookup in the system password file).
