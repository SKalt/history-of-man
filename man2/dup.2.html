<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The
<B>dup</B>()

system call creates a copy of the file descriptor
<I>oldfd</I>,

using the lowest-numbered unused descriptor for the new descriptor.
<P>
After a successful return,
the old and new file descriptors may be used interchangeably.
They refer to the same open file description (see
<B><A HREF="../man2/open.2.html">open</A></B>(2))

and thus share file offset and file status flags;
for example, if the file offset is modified by using
<B><A HREF="../man2/lseek.2.html">lseek</A></B>(2)

on one of the descriptors, the offset is also changed for the other.
<P>
The two descriptors do not share file descriptor flags
(the close-on-exec flag).
The close-on-exec flag
(<B>FD_CLOEXEC</B>;

see
<B><A HREF="../man2/fcntl.2.html">fcntl</A></B>(2))

for the duplicate descriptor is off.

<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>dup2()</H3>

The
<B>dup2</B>()

system call performs the same task as
<B>dup</B>(),

but instead of using the lowest-numbered unused file descriptor,
it uses the descriptor number specified in
<I>newfd</I>.

If the descriptor
<I>newfd</I>

was previously open, it is silently closed before being reused.
<P>
The steps of closing and reusing the file descriptor
<I>newfd</I>

are performed
<I>atomically</I>.

This is important, because trying to implement equivalent functionality using
<B><A HREF="../man2/close.2.html">close</A></B>(2)

and
<B>dup</B>()

would be
subject to race conditions, whereby
<I>newfd</I>

might be reused between the two steps.
Such reuse could happen because the main program is interrupted
by a signal handler that allocates a file descriptor,
or because a parallel thread allocates a file descriptor.
<P>
Note the following points:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
If
<I>oldfd</I>

is not a valid file descriptor, then the call fails, and
<I>newfd</I>

is not closed.
<DT>*<DD>
If
<I>oldfd</I>

is a valid file descriptor, and
<I>newfd</I>

has the same value as
<I>oldfd</I>,

then
<B>dup2</B>()

does nothing, and returns
<I>newfd</I>.


</DL>
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>dup3()</H3>

<B>dup3</B>()

is the same as
<B>dup2</B>(),

except that:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
The caller can force the close-on-exec flag to be set
for the new file descriptor by specifying
<B>O_CLOEXEC</B>

in
<I>flags</I>.

See the description of the same flag in
<B><A HREF="../man2/open.2.html">open</A></B>(2)

for reasons why this may be useful.
<DT>*<DD>

If
<I>oldfd</I>

equals
<I>newfd</I>,

then
<B>dup3</B>()

fails with the error
<B>EINVAL</B>.

</DL>
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

On success, these system calls
return the new descriptor.
On error, -1 is returned, and
<I>errno</I>

is set appropriately.
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EBADF</B>

<DD>
<I>oldfd</I>

isn't an open file descriptor, or
<I>newfd</I>

is out of the allowed range for file descriptors.
<DT><B>EBUSY</B>

<DD>
(Linux only) This may be returned by
<B>dup2</B>()

or
<B>dup3</B>()

during a race condition with
<B><A HREF="../man2/open.2.html">open</A></B>(2)

and
<B>dup</B>().

<DT><B>EINTR</B>

<DD>
The
<B>dup2</B>()

or
<B>dup3</B>()

call was interrupted by a signal; see
<B><A HREF="../man7/signal.7.html">signal</A></B>(7).

<DT><B>EINVAL</B>

<DD>
(<B>dup3</B>())

<I>flags</I>

contain an invalid value.

Or,
<I>oldfd</I>

was equal to
<I>newfd</I>.

<DT><B>EMFILE</B>

<DD>
The process already has the maximum number of file
descriptors open and tried to open a new one.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>VERSIONS</H2>

<B>dup3</B>()

was added to Linux in version 2.6.27;
glibc support is available starting with
version 2.9.
<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>CONFORMING TO</H2>

<B>dup</B>(),

<B>dup2</B>():

SVr4, 4.3BSD, POSIX.1-2001.
<P>
<B>dup3</B>()

is Linux-specific.



<A NAME="lbAK">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NOTES</H2>

The error returned by
<B>dup2</B>()

is different from that returned by
<B>fcntl(</B>..., <B>F_DUPFD</B>, ...<B>)</B>

when
<I>newfd</I>

is out of range.
On some systems,
<B>dup2</B>()

also sometimes returns
<B>EINVAL</B>

like
<B>F_DUPFD</B>.

<P>
If
<I>newfd</I>

was open, any errors that would have been reported at
<B><A HREF="../man2/close.2.html">close</A></B>(2)

time are lost.
If this is of concern,
then---unless the program is single-threaded and does not allocate
file descriptors in signal handlers---the correct approach is
<I>not</I>

to close
<I>newfd</I>

before calling
<B>dup2</B>(),

because of the race condition described above.
Instead, code something like the following could be used:
<P>
<PRE>
    /* Obtain a duplicate of 'newfd' that can subsequently
       be used to check for close() errors; an EBADF error
       means that 'newfd' was not open. */

    tmpfd = dup(newfd);
    if (tmpfd == -1 &amp;&amp; errno != EBADF) {
        /* Handle unexpected dup() error */
    }

    /* Atomically duplicate 'oldfd' on 'newfd' */

    if (dup2(oldfd, newfd) == -1) {
        /* Handle dup2() error */
    }

    /* Now check for close() errors on the file originally
       referred to by 'newfd' */

    if (tmpfd != -1) {
        if (close(tmpfd) == -1) {
            /* Handle errors from close */
        }
    }
</PRE>
