.TH EPOLL_WAIT 2 2012-08-17 "Linux" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
epoll_wait, epoll_pwait \- wait for an I/O event on an epoll file descriptor
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include &lt;sys/epoll.h&gt;
.sp
.BI "int epoll_wait(int " epfd ", struct epoll_event *" events ,
.BI "               int " maxevents ", int " timeout );
.BI "int epoll_pwait(int " epfd ", struct epoll_event *" events ,
.BI "               int " maxevents ", int " timeout ,
.BI "               const sigset_t *" sigmask );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR epoll_wait ()
system call waits for events on the
.BR epoll (7)
instance referred to by the file descriptor
.IR epfd .
The memory area pointed to by
.I events
will contain the events that will be available for the caller.
Up to
.I maxevents
are returned by
.BR epoll_wait ().
The
.I maxevents
argument must be greater than zero.

The
.I timeout
argument specifies the minimum number of milliseconds that
.BR epoll_wait ()
will block.
(This interval will be rounded up to the system clock granularity,
and kernel scheduling delays mean that the blocking interval
may overrun by a small amount.)
Specifying a
.I timeout
of \-1 causes
.BR epoll_wait ()
to block indefinitely, while specifying a
.I timeout
equal to zero cause
.BR epoll_wait ()
to return immediately, even if no events are available.

The
.I struct epoll_event
is defined as :
.sp
.in +4n
.nf
typedef union epoll_data {
    void    *ptr;
    int      fd;
    uint32_t u32;
    uint64_t u64;
} epoll_data_t;

struct epoll_event {
    uint32_t     events;    /* Epoll events */
    epoll_data_t data;      /* User data variable */
};
.fi
.in

The
.I data
of each returned structure will contain the same data the user set with an
.BR epoll_ctl (2)
.RB ( EPOLL_CTL_ADD , EPOLL_CTL_MOD )
while the
.I events
member will contain the returned event bit field.
.SS epoll_pwait()
The relationship between
.BR epoll_wait ()
and
.BR epoll_pwait ()
is analogous to the relationship between
.BR select (2)
and
.BR pselect (2):
like
.BR pselect (2),
.BR epoll_pwait ()
allows an application to safely wait until either a file descriptor
becomes ready or until a signal is caught.

The following
.BR epoll_pwait ()
call:
.nf

    ready = epoll_pwait(epfd, &amp;events, maxevents, timeout, &amp;sigmask);

.fi
is equivalent to
.I atomically
executing the following calls:
.nf

    sigset_t origmask;

    sigprocmask(SIG_SETMASK, &amp;sigmask, &amp;origmask);
    ready = epoll_wait(epfd, &amp;events, maxevents, timeout);
    sigprocmask(SIG_SETMASK, &amp;origmask, NULL);
.fi
.PP
The
.I sigmask
argument may be specified as NULL, in which case
.BR epoll_pwait ()
is equivalent to
.BR epoll_wait ().
.SH RETURN VALUE
When successful,
.BR epoll_wait ()
returns the number of file descriptors ready for the requested I/O, or zero
if no file descriptor became ready during the requested
.I timeout
milliseconds.
When an error occurs,
.BR epoll_wait ()
returns \-1 and
.I errno
is set appropriately.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EBADF
.I epfd
is not a valid file descriptor.
.TP
.B EFAULT
The memory area pointed to by
.I events
is not accessible with write permissions.
.TP
.B EINTR
The call was interrupted by a signal handler before either any of the
requested events occurred or the
.I timeout
expired; see
.BR signal (7).
.TP
.B EINVAL
.I epfd
is not an
.B epoll
file descriptor, or
.I maxevents
is less than or equal to zero.
.SH VERSIONS
.BR epoll_wait ()
was added to the kernel in version 2.6.
To be precise: kernel 2.5.44.
The interface should be finalized by Linux kernel 2.5.66.
Library support is provided in glibc starting with version 2.3.2.

.BR epoll_pwait ()
was added to Linux in kernel 2.6.19.
Library support is provided in glibc starting with version 2.6.
.SH CONFORMING TO
.BR epoll_wait ()
is Linux-specific.
.SH NOTES
While one thread is blocked in a call to
.BR epoll_pwait (),
it is possible for another thread to add a file descriptor to the waited-upon
.B epoll
instance.
If the new file descriptor becomes ready,
it will cause the
.BR epoll_wait ()
call to unblock.

For a discussion of what may happen if a file descriptor in an
.B epoll
instance being monitored by
.BR epoll_wait ()
is closed in another thread, see
.BR select (2).
.SH BUGS
In kernels before 2.6.37, a
.I timeout
value larger than approximately
.I LONG_MAX / HZ
milliseconds is treated as \-1 (i.e., infinity).
Thus, for example, on a system where the
.I sizeof(long)
is 4 and the kernel
.I HZ
value is 1000,
this means that timeouts greater than 35.79 minutes are treated as infinity.
