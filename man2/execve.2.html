<H2>NAME</H2>

execve - execute program
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>#include &lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/unistd.h">unistd.h</A>&gt;</B>

<P>
<B>int execve(const char *</B><I>filename</I><B>, char *const </B><I>argv</I>

<B>[], char *const </B><I>envp</I><B>[]);</B>

<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B>execve()</B> executes the program pointed to by <I>filename</I>.
<I>filename</I> must be either a binary executable, or a script
starting with a line of the form &quot;<B>#! </B><I>interpreter </I>[arg]&quot;.
In the latter case, the interpreter must be a valid pathname for an
executable which is not itself a script, which will be invoked as
<B>interpreter</B> [arg] <I>filename</I>.
<P>
<I>argv</I> is an array of argument strings passed to the new program.
<I>envp</I> is an array of strings, conventionally of the form
<B>key=value</B>, which are passed as environment to the new
program.  Both <I>argv</I> and <I>envp</I> must be terminated by a null
pointer.  The argument vector and environment can be accessed by the
called program's main function, when it is defined as <B>int main(int
argc, char *argv[], char *envp[])</B>.
<P>
<B>execve()</B> does not return on success, and the text, data, bss, and
stack of the calling process are overwritten by that of the program
loaded.  The program invoked inherits the calling process's PID, and any
open file descriptors that are not set to close on exec.  Signals pending
on the calling process are cleared.  Any signals set to be caught by
the calling process are reset to their default behaviour.
The SIGCHLD signal (when set to SIG_IGN) may or may not be reset to SIG_DFL.
<P>
If the current program is being ptraced, a <B>SIGTRAP</B> is sent to it
after a successful <B>execve()</B>.
<P>
If the set-uid bit is set on the program file pointed to by
<I>filename</I> the effective user ID of the calling process is changed
to that of the owner of the program file.  Similarly, when the set-gid
bit of the program file is set the effective group ID of the calling
process is set to the group of the program file.
<P>
If the executable is an a.out dynamically-linked binary executable containing
shared-library stubs, the Linux dynamic linker
<B><A HREF="../man8/ld.so.8.html">ld.so</A></B>(8)

is called at the start of execution to bring needed shared libraries into core
and link the executable with them.
<P>
If the executable is a dynamically-linked ELF executable, the
interpreter named in the PT_INTERP segment is used to load the needed
shared libraries.  This interpreter is typically
<I>/lib/ld-linux.so.1</I> for binaries linked with the Linux libc
version 5, or <I>/lib/ld-linux.so.2</I> for binaries linked with the
GNU libc version 2.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

On success, <B>execve()</B> does not return, on error -1 is returned, and
<I>errno</I>

is set appropriately.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>E2BIG</B>

<DD>
The argument list is too big.
<DT><B>EACCES</B>

<DD>
Search permission is denied on a component of the path prefix of
<I>filename</I>

or the name of a script interpreter.
(See also
<B><A HREF="../man2/path_resolution.2.html">path_resolution</A></B>(2).)

<DT><B>EACCES</B>

<DD>
The file or a script interpreter is not a regular file.
<DT><B>EACCES</B>

<DD>
Execute permission is denied for the file or a script or ELF interpreter.

<DD>
<I>filename</I>

points outside your accessible address space.
<DT><B>EINVAL</B>

<DD>
An ELF executable had more than one PT_INTERP segment (i.e., tried to
name more than one interpreter).
<DT><B>EIO</B>

<DD>
An I/O error occurred.
<DT><B>EISDIR</B>

<DD>
An ELF interpreter was a directory.
<DT><B>ELIBBAD</B>

<DD>
An ELF interpreter was not in a recognised format.
<DT><B>ELOOP</B>

<DD>
Too many symbolic links were encountered in resolving
<I>filename</I>

or the name of a script or ELF interpreter.
<DT><B>EMFILE</B>

<DD>
The process has the maximum number of files open.
<DT><B>ENAMETOOLONG</B>

<DD>
<I>filename</I>

is too long.
<DT><B>ENFILE</B>

<DD>
The system limit on the total number of open files has been reached.
<DT><B>ENOENT</B>

<DD>
The file 
<I>filename</I>

or a script or ELF interpreter does not exist, or a shared library
needed for file or interpreter cannot be found.
<DT><B>ENOEXEC</B>

<DD>
An executable is not in a recognised format, is for the wrong
architecture, or has some other format error that means it cannot be
executed.
<DT><B>ENOMEM</B>

<DD>
Insufficient kernel memory was available.
<DT><B>ENOTDIR</B>

<DD>
A component of the path prefix of
<I>filename</I>

or a script or ELF interpreter is not a directory.
<DT><B>EPERM</B>

<DD>
The file system is mounted
<I>nosuid</I>,

the user is not the superuser, and the file has an SUID or SGID bit set.
<DT><B>EPERM</B>

<DD>
The process is being traced, the user is not the superuser and the
file has an SUID or SGID bit set.
<DT><B>ETXTBSY</B>

<DD>
Executable was open for writing by one or more processes.

<H2>CONFORMING TO</H2>

SVr4, SVID, X/OPEN, BSD 4.3.  POSIX does not document the #!  behavior
but is otherwise compatible.  SVr4 documents additional error
conditions EAGAIN, EINTR, ELIBACC, ENOLINK, EMULTIHOP; POSIX does not
document ETXTBSY, EPERM, EFAULT, ELOOP, EIO, ENFILE, EMFILE, EINVAL,
EISDIR or ELIBBAD error conditions.
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NOTES</H2>

SUID and SGID processes can not be <B>ptrace()</B>d.
<P>
Linux ignores the SUID and SGID bits on scripts.
<P>
The result of mounting a filesystem
<I>nosuid</I>

vary between Linux kernel versions:
some will refuse execution of SUID/SGID executables when this would
give the user powers she did not have already (and return EPERM),
some will just ignore the SUID/SGID bits and exec successfully.
<P>
A maximum line length of 127 characters is allowed for the first line in
a #! executable shell script. 







<P>
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>HISTORICAL</H2>

With Unix V6 the argument list of an exec call was ended by 0,
while the argument list of
<I>main</I>

was ended by -1. Thus, this
argument list was not directly usable in a further exec call.
Since Unix V7 both are NULL.
