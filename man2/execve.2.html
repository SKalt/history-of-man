execve - execute program
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>#include &lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/unistd.h">unistd.h</A>&gt;</B>

<P>
<B>int execve(const char *</B><I>filename</I><B>, char *const </B><I>argv</I><B>[], </B>

<BR>

<B>           char *const </B><I>envp</I><B>[]);</B>

<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B>execve</B>()

executes the program pointed to by <I>filename</I>.
<I>filename</I> must be either a binary executable, or a script
starting with a line of the form:
<P>

<PRE>
<B>#!</B> <I>interpreter </I>[optional-arg]
</PRE>


<P>
For details of the latter case, see &quot;Interpreter scripts&quot; below.
<P>
<I>argv</I> is an array of argument strings passed to the new program.
By convention, the first of these strings should contain the filename
associated with the file being executed.
<I>envp</I> is an array of strings, conventionally of the form
<B>key=value</B>, which are passed as environment to the new program.
Both <I>argv</I> and <I>envp</I> must be terminated by a null pointer.
The argument vector and environment can be accessed by the
called program's main function, when it is defined as:
<P>

<PRE>
int main(int argc, char *argv[], char *envp[])
</PRE>


<P>
<B>execve</B>()

does not return on success, and the text, data, bss, and
stack of the calling process are overwritten by that of the program
loaded.
<P>
If the current program is being ptraced, a <B>SIGTRAP</B> is sent to it
after a successful
<B>execve</B>().

<P>
If the set-user-ID bit is set on the program file pointed to by
<I>filename</I>,
and the underlying filesystem is not mounted
<I>nosuid</I>

(the
<B>MS_NOSUID</B>

flag for
<B><A HREF="../man2/mount.2.html">mount</A></B>(2)),

and the calling process is not being ptraced,
then the effective user ID of the calling process is changed
to that of the owner of the program file.
Similarly, when the set-group-ID
bit of the program file is set the effective group ID of the calling
process is set to the group of the program file.
<P>
The effective user ID of the process is copied to the saved set-user-ID;
similarly, the effective group ID is copied to the saved set-group-ID.
This copying takes place after any effective ID changes that occur
because of the set-user-ID and set-group-ID permission bits.
<P>
If the executable is an a.out dynamically linked
binary executable containing
shared-library stubs, the Linux dynamic linker
<B><A HREF="../man8/ld.so.8.html">ld.so</A></B>(8)

is called at the start of execution to bring
needed shared libraries into memory
and link the executable with them.
<P>
If the executable is a dynamically linked ELF executable, the
interpreter named in the PT_INTERP segment is used to load the needed
shared libraries.
This interpreter is typically
<I>/lib/ld-linux.so.2</I>

for binaries linked with glibc 2.
(For binaries linked with the old Linux libc5, the interpreter was typically
<I>/lib/ld-linux.so.1</I>.)

<P>
All process attributes are preserved during an
<B>execve</B>(),

except the following:
<DL COMPACT>

</DL>
<P>

The process attributes in the preceding list are all specified
in POSIX.1-2001.
The following Linux-specific process attributes are also
not preserved during an
<B>execve</B>():

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
The
<B><A HREF="../man2/prctl.2.html">prctl</A></B>(2)

<B>PR_SET_DUMPABLE</B>

flag is set,
unless a set-user-ID or set-group ID program is being executed,
in which case it is cleared.
<DT>*<DD>
The
<B><A HREF="../man2/prctl.2.html">prctl</A></B>(2)

<B>PR_SET_KEEPCAPS</B>

flag is cleared.
<DT>*<DD>
(Since Linux 2.4.36 / 2.6.23)
If a set-user-ID or set-group-ID program is being executed,
then the parent death signal set by
<B><A HREF="../man2/prctl.2.html">prctl</A></B>(2)

<B>PR_SET_PDEATHSIG</B>

flag is cleared.
<DT>*<DD>

<B><A HREF="../man2/prctl.2.html">prctl</A></B>(2)

<B>PR_SET_NAME</B>

(and displayed by

is reset to the name of the new executable file.
<DT>*<DD>
The
<B>SECBIT_KEEP_CAPS</B>

<I>securebits</I>

flag is cleared.
See
<B><A HREF="../man7/capabilities.7.html">capabilities</A></B>(7).

<DT>*<DD>
The termination signal is reset to
<B>SIGCHLD</B>

(see
<B><A HREF="../man2/clone.2.html">clone</A></B>(2)).

</DL>
<P>

Note the following further points:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
All threads other than the calling thread are destroyed during an
<B>execve</B>().

Mutexes, condition variables, and other pthreads objects are not preserved.
<DT>*<DD>
The equivalent of <I>setlocale(LC_ALL, &quot;C&quot;)</I>
is executed at program start-up.
<DT>*<DD>
POSIX.1-2001 specifies that the dispositions of any signals that
are ignored or set to the default are left unchanged.
POSIX.1-2001 specifies one exception: if
<B>SIGCHLD</B>

is being ignored,
then an implementation may leave the disposition unchanged or
reset it to the default; Linux does the former.
<DT>*<DD>
Any outstanding asynchronous I/O operations are canceled
(<B><A HREF="../man3/aio_read.3.html">aio_read</A></B>(3),

<B><A HREF="../man3/aio_write.3.html">aio_write</A></B>(3)).

<DT>*<DD>
For the handling of capabilities during
<B>execve</B>(),

see
<B><A HREF="../man7/capabilities.7.html">capabilities</A></B>(7).

<DT>*<DD>
By default, file descriptors remain open across an
<B>execve</B>().

File descriptors that are marked close-on-exec are closed;
see the description of
<B>FD_CLOEXEC</B>

in
<B><A HREF="../man2/fcntl.2.html">fcntl</A></B>(2).

(If a file descriptor is closed, this will cause the release
of all record locks obtained on the underlying file by this process.
See
<B><A HREF="../man2/fcntl.2.html">fcntl</A></B>(2)

for details.)
POSIX.1-2001 says that if file descriptors 0, 1, and 2 would
otherwise be closed after a successful
<B>execve</B>(),

and the process would gain privilege because the set-user_ID or
set-group_ID permission bit was set on the executed file,
then the system may open an unspecified file for each of these
file descriptors.
As a general principle, no portable program, whether privileged or not,
can assume that these three file descriptors will remain
closed across an
<B>execve</B>().

<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Interpreter scripts</H3>

An interpreter script is a text file that has execute
permission enabled and whose first line is of the form:
<P>

<PRE>
<B>#!</B> <I>interpreter </I>[optional-arg]
</PRE>


<P>
The
<I>interpreter</I>

must be a valid pathname for an
executable which is not itself a script.
If the
<I>filename</I>

argument of
<B>execve</B>()

specifies an interpreter script, then
<I>interpreter</I>

will be invoked with the following arguments:
<P>

<PRE>
<I>interpreter</I> [optional-arg] <I>filename</I> arg...
</PRE>


<P>
where
<I>arg...</I>

is the series of words pointed to by the
<I>argv</I>

argument of
<B>execve</B>(),

starting at
<I>argv</I>[1].

<P>
For portable use,
<I>optional-arg</I>

should either be absent, or be specified as a single word (i.e., it
should not contain white space); see NOTES below.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Limits on size of arguments and environment</H3>

Most UNIX implementations impose some limit on the total size
of the command-line argument
(<I>argv</I>)

and environment
(<I>envp</I>)

strings that may be passed to a new program.
POSIX.1 allows an implementation to advertise this limit using the
<B>ARG_MAX</B>

constant (either defined in
<I>&lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/limits.h">limits.h</A>&gt;</I>

or available at run time using the call
<I>sysconf(_SC_ARG_MAX)</I>).

<P>
On Linux prior to kernel 2.6.23, the memory used to store the
environment and argument strings was limited to 32 pages
(defined by the kernel constant
<B>MAX_ARG_PAGES</B>).

On architectures with a 4-kB page size,
this yields a maximum size of 128 kB.
<P>
On kernel 2.6.23 and later, most architectures support a size limit
derived from the soft
<B>RLIMIT_STACK</B>

resource limit (see
<B><A HREF="../man2/getrlimit.2.html">getrlimit</A></B>(2))

that is in force at the time of the
<B>execve</B>()

call.
(Architectures with no memory management unit are excepted:
they maintain the limit that was in effect before kernel 2.6.23.)
This change allows programs to have a much larger
argument and/or environment list.






For these architectures, the total size is limited to 1/4 of the allowed
stack size.
(Imposing the 1/4-limit
ensures that the new program always has some stack space.)


Since Linux 2.6.25,
the kernel places a floor of 32 pages on this size limit,
so that, even when
<B>RLIMIT_STACK</B>

is set very low,
applications are guaranteed to have at least as much argument and
environment space as was provided by Linux 2.6.23 and earlier.
(This guarantee was not provided in Linux 2.6.23 and 2.6.24.)
Additionally, the limit per string is 32 pages (the kernel constant
<B>MAX_ARG_STRLEN</B>),

and the maximum number of strings is 0x7FFFFFFF.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

On success,
<B>execve</B>()

does not return, on error -1 is returned, and
<I>errno</I>

is set appropriately.

<H2>CONFORMING TO</H2>

SVr4, 4.3BSD, POSIX.1-2001.
POSIX.1-2001 does not document the #!  behavior
but is otherwise compatible.




<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NOTES</H2>

Set-user-ID and set-group-ID processes can not be
<B><A HREF="../man2/ptrace.2.html">ptrace</A></B>(2)d.

<P>
Linux ignores the set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits on scripts.
<P>
The result of mounting a filesystem
<I>nosuid</I>

varies across Linux kernel versions:
some will refuse execution of set-user-ID and set-group-ID
executables when this would
give the user powers she did not have already (and return
<B>EPERM</B>),

some will just ignore the set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits and
<B>exec</B>()

successfully.
<P>
A maximum line length of 127 characters is allowed for the first line in
a #! executable shell script.
<P>
The semantics of the
<I>optional-arg</I>

argument of an interpreter script vary across implementations.
On Linux, the entire string following the
<I>interpreter</I>

name is passed as a single argument to the interpreter,
and this string can include white space.
However, behavior differs on some other systems.
Some systems

use the first white space to terminate
<I>optional-arg</I>.

On some systems,

an interpreter script can have multiple arguments,
and white spaces in
<I>optional-arg</I>

are used to delimit the arguments.
<P>
On Linux, either
<I>argv</I>

or
<I>envp</I>

can be specified as NULL,
which has the same effect as specifying these arguments
as a pointer to a list containing a single null pointer.
<B>Do not take advantage of this misfeature!</B>

It is nonstandard and nonportable:
on most other UNIX systems doing this will result in an error
(<B>EFAULT</B>).






<P>
POSIX.1-2001 says that values returned by
<B><A HREF="../man3/sysconf.3.html">sysconf</A></B>(3)

should be invariant over the lifetime of a process.
However, since Linux 2.6.23, if the
<B>RLIMIT_STACK</B>

resource limit changes, then the value reported by
<B>_SC_ARG_MAX</B>

will also change,
to reflect the fact that the limit on space for holding
command-line arguments and environment variables has changed.









<A NAME="lbAK">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Historical</H3>

With UNIX V6 the argument list of an
<B>exec</B>()

call was ended by 0,
while the argument list of
<I>main</I>

was ended by -1.
Thus, this argument list was not directly usable in a further
<B>exec</B>()

call.
Since UNIX V7 both are NULL.
<A NAME="lbAL">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>EXAMPLE</H2>

The following program is designed to be execed by the second program below.
It just echoes its command-line arguments, one per line.
<P>

<PRE>
/* myecho.c */

#include &lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/stdio.h">stdio.h</A>&gt;
#include &lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/stdlib.h">stdlib.h</A>&gt;

int
main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    int j;

    for (j = 0; j &lt; argc; j++)
        printf(&quot;argv[%d]: %s\n&quot;, j, argv[j]);

    exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
}
</PRE>


<P>
This program can be used to exec the program named in its command-line
argument:

<PRE>

/* execve.c */

#include &lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/stdio.h">stdio.h</A>&gt;
#include &lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/stdlib.h">stdlib.h</A>&gt;
#include &lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/unistd.h">unistd.h</A>&gt;

int
main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    char *newargv[] = { NULL, &quot;hello&quot;, &quot;world&quot;, NULL };
    char *newenviron[] = { NULL };

    if (argc != 2) {
        fprintf(stderr, &quot;Usage: %s &lt;file-to-exec&gt;\n&quot;, argv[0]);
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    newargv[0] = argv[1];

    execve(argv[1], newargv, newenviron);
    perror(&quot;execve&quot;);   /* execve() only returns on error */
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}
</PRE>


<P>
We can use the second program to exec the first as follows:
<P>

<PRE>
$<B> cc myecho.c -o myecho</B>
$<B> cc execve.c -o execve</B>
$<B> ./execve ./myecho</B>
argv[0]: ./myecho
argv[1]: hello
argv[2]: world
</PRE>


<P>
We can also use these programs to demonstrate the use of a script
interpreter.
To do this we create a script whose &quot;interpreter&quot; is our
<I>myecho</I>

program:
<P>

<PRE>
$<B> cat &gt; script.sh</B>
<B>#! ./myecho script-arg</B>
<B>^D</B>
$<B> chmod +x script.sh</B>
</PRE>


<P>
We can then use our program to exec the script:
<P>

<PRE>
$<B> ./execve ./script.sh</B>
argv[0]: ./myecho
argv[1]: script-arg
argv[2]: ./script.sh
argv[3]: hello
argv[4]: world
</PRE>
