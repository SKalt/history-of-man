<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B>fcntl</B>()

performs one of the operations described below on the open file descriptor
<I>fd</I>.

The operation is determined by
<I>cmd</I>.

<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Duplicating a file descriptor</H3>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>F_DUPFD</B>

<DD>
Find the lowest numbered available file descriptor
greater than or equal to
<I>arg</I>

and make it be a copy of
<I>fd</I>.

This is different from
<B><A HREF="../man2/dup2.2.html">dup2</A></B>(2)

which uses exactly the descriptor specified.
<DT><DD>
On success, the new descriptor is returned.
<DT><DD>
See
<B><A HREF="../man2/dup.2.html">dup</A></B>(2)

for further details.
<DT><B>F_DUPFD_CLOEXEC</B> (since Linux 2.6.24)

<DD>
As for
<B>F_DUPFD</B>,

but additionally set the
close-on-exec flag for the duplicate descriptor.
Specifying this flag permits a program to avoid an additional
<B>fcntl</B>()

<B>F_SETFD</B>

operation to set the
<B>FD_CLOEXEC</B>

flag.
For an explanation of why this flag is useful,
see the description of
<B>O_CLOEXEC</B>

in
<B><A HREF="../man2/open.2.html">open</A></B>(2).

</DL>
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>File descriptor flags</H3>

The following commands manipulate the flags associated with
a file descriptor.
Currently, only one such flag is defined:
<B>FD_CLOEXEC</B>,

the close-on-exec flag.
If the
<B>FD_CLOEXEC</B>

bit is 0, the file descriptor will remain open across an
<B><A HREF="../man2/execve.2.html">execve</A></B>(2),

otherwise it will be closed.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>F_GETFD</B>

<DD>
Read the file descriptor flags.
<DT><B>F_SETFD</B>

<DD>
Set the file descriptor flags to the value specified by
<I>arg</I>.

</DL>
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>File status flags</H3>

Each open file description has certain associated status flags,
initialized by
<B><A HREF="../man2/open.2.html">open</A></B>(2)



and possibly modified by
<B>fcntl</B>().

Duplicated file descriptors
(made with
<B><A HREF="../man2/dup.2.html">dup</A></B>(2),

<B>fcntl</B>(F_DUPFD),

<B><A HREF="../man2/fork.2.html">fork</A></B>(2),

etc.) refer to the same open file description, and thus
share the same file status flags.
<P>
The file status flags and their semantics are described in
<B><A HREF="../man2/open.2.html">open</A></B>(2).

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>F_GETFL</B>

<DD>
Read the file status flags.
<DT><B>F_SETFL</B>

<DD>
Set the file status flags to the value specified by
<I>arg</I>.

File access mode
(<B>O_RDONLY</B>, <B>O_WRONLY</B>, <B>O_RDWR</B>)

and file creation flags
(i.e.,
<B>O_CREAT</B>, <B>O_EXCL</B>, <B>O_NOCTTY</B>, <B>O_TRUNC</B>)

in
<I>arg</I>

are ignored.
On Linux this command can only change the
<B>O_APPEND</B>,

<B>O_ASYNC</B>,

<B>O_DIRECT</B>,

<B>O_NOATIME</B>,

and
<B>O_NONBLOCK</B>

flags.



</DL>
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Advisory locking</H3>

<B>F_GETLK</B>, <B>F_SETLK</B> and <B>F_SETLKW</B>

are used to acquire, release, and test for the existence of record
locks (also known as file-segment or file-region locks).
The third argument
<I>lock</I>

is a pointer to a structure that has at least the following fields
(in unspecified order).

<PRE>

struct flock {
    ...
    short l_type;    /* Type of lock: F_RDLCK,
                        F_WRLCK, F_UNLCK */
    short l_whence;  /* How to interpret l_start:
                        SEEK_SET, SEEK_CUR, SEEK_END */
    off_t l_start;   /* Starting offset for lock */
    off_t l_len;     /* Number of bytes to lock */
    pid_t l_pid;     /* PID of process blocking our lock
                        (F_GETLK only) */
    ...
};
</PRE>


<P>

The
<I>l_whence</I>, <I>l_start</I>, and <I>l_len</I>

fields of this structure specify the range of bytes we wish to lock.
<I>l_start</I>

is the starting offset for the lock, and is interpreted
relative to either:
the start of the file (if
<I>l_whence</I>

is
<B>SEEK_SET</B>);

the current file offset (if
<I>l_whence</I>

is
<B>SEEK_CUR</B>);

or the end of the file (if
<I>l_whence</I>

is
<B>SEEK_END</B>).

In the final two cases,
<I>l_start</I>

can be a negative number provided the
offset does not lie before the start of the file.
<I>l_len</I>

is a non-negative integer (but see the NOTES below) specifying
the number of bytes to be locked.
Bytes past the end of the file may be locked,
but not bytes before the start of the file.
Specifying 0 for
<I>l_len</I>

has the special meaning: lock all bytes starting at the
location specified by
<I>l_whence</I> and <I>l_start</I>

through to the end of file, no matter how large the file grows.
<P>

The
<I>l_type</I>

field can be used to place a read
(<B>F_RDLCK</B>)

or a write
(<B>F_WRLCK</B>)

lock on a file.
Any number of processes may hold a read lock (shared lock)
on a file region, but only one process may hold a write lock
(exclusive lock).
An exclusive lock excludes all other locks,
both shared and exclusive.
A single process can hold only one type of lock on a file region;
if a new lock is applied to an already-locked region,
then the existing lock is converted to the new lock type.
(Such conversions may involve splitting, shrinking, or coalescing with
an existing lock if the byte range specified by the new lock does not
precisely coincide with the range of the existing lock.)
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>F_SETLK</B>

<DD>
Acquire a lock (when
<I>l_type</I>

is
<B>F_RDLCK</B>

or
<B>F_WRLCK</B>)

or release a lock (when
<I>l_type</I>

is
<B>F_UNLCK</B>)

on the bytes specified by the
<I>l_whence</I>, <I>l_start</I>, and <I>l_len</I>

fields of
<I>lock</I>.

If a conflicting lock is held by another process,
this call returns -1 and sets
<I>errno</I>

to
<B>EACCES</B>

or
<B>EAGAIN</B>.

<DT><B>F_SETLKW</B>

<DD>
As for
<B>F_SETLK</B>,

but if a conflicting lock is held on the file, then wait for that
lock to be released.
If a signal is caught while waiting, then the call is interrupted
and (after the signal handler has returned)
returns immediately (with return value -1 and
<I>errno</I>

set to
<B>EINTR</B>;

see
<B><A HREF="../man7/signal.7.html">signal</A></B>(7)).

<DT><B>F_GETLK</B>

<DD>
On input to this call,
<I>lock</I>

describes a lock we would like to place on the file.
If the lock could be placed,
<B>fcntl</B>()

does not actually place it, but returns
<B>F_UNLCK</B>

in the
<I>l_type</I>

field of
<I>lock</I>

and leaves the other fields of the structure unchanged.
If one or more incompatible locks would prevent
this lock being placed, then
<B>fcntl</B>()

returns details about one of these locks in the
<I>l_type</I>, <I>l_whence</I>, <I>l_start</I>, and <I>l_len</I>

fields of
<I>lock</I>

and sets
<I>l_pid</I>

to be the PID of the process holding that lock.
</DL>
<P>

In order to place a read lock,
<I>fd</I>

must be open for reading.
In order to place a write lock,
<I>fd</I>

must be open for writing.
To place both types of lock, open a file read-write.
<P>

As well as being removed by an explicit
<B>F_UNLCK</B>,

record locks are automatically released when the process
terminates or if it closes
<I>any</I>

file descriptor referring to a file on which locks are held.



This is bad: it means that a process can lose the locks on
a file like
<I>/etc/passwd</I>

or
<I>/etc/mtab</I>

when for some reason a library function decides to open, read
and close it.
<P>

Record locks are not inherited by a child created via
<B><A HREF="../man2/fork.2.html">fork</A></B>(2),

but are preserved across an
<B><A HREF="../man2/execve.2.html">execve</A></B>(2).

<P>

Because of the buffering performed by the
<B><A HREF="../man3/stdio.3.html">stdio</A></B>(3)

library, the use of record locking with routines in that package
should be avoided; use
<B><A HREF="../man2/read.2.html">read</A></B>(2)

and
<B><A HREF="../man2/write.2.html">write</A></B>(2)

instead.
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Mandatory locking</H3>

(Non-POSIX.)
The above record locks may be either advisory or mandatory,
and are advisory by default.
<P>
Advisory locks are not enforced and are useful only between
cooperating processes.
<P>
Mandatory locks are enforced for all processes.
If a process tries to perform an incompatible access (e.g.,
<B><A HREF="../man2/read.2.html">read</A></B>(2)

or
<B><A HREF="../man2/write.2.html">write</A></B>(2))

on a file region that has an incompatible mandatory lock,
then the result depends upon whether the
<B>O_NONBLOCK</B>

flag is enabled for its open file description.
If the
<B>O_NONBLOCK</B>

flag is not enabled, then
system call is blocked until the lock is removed
or converted to a mode that is compatible with the access.
If the
<B>O_NONBLOCK</B>

flag is enabled, then the system call fails with the error
<B>EAGAIN</B>

or
<B>EWOULDBLOCK</B>.

<P>
To make use of mandatory locks, mandatory locking must be enabled
both on the file system that contains the file to be locked,
and on the file itself.
Mandatory locking is enabled on a file system
using the &quot;-o mand&quot; option to
<B><A HREF="../man8/mount.8.html">mount</A></B>(8),

or the
<B>MS_MANDLOCK</B>

flag for
<B><A HREF="../man2/mount.2.html">mount</A></B>(2).

Mandatory locking is enabled on a file by disabling
group execute permission on the file and enabling the set-group-ID
permission bit (see
<B><A HREF="../man1/chmod.1.html">chmod</A></B>(1)

and
<B><A HREF="../man2/chmod.2.html">chmod</A></B>(2)).

<P>
The Linux implementation of mandatory locking is unreliable.
See BUGS below.
<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Managing signals</H3>

<B>F_GETOWN</B>, <B>F_SETOWN</B>, <B>F_GETSIG</B> and <B>F_SETSIG</B>

are used to manage I/O availability signals:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>F_GETOWN</B>

<DD>
Get the process ID or process group currently receiving
<B>SIGIO</B>

and
<B>SIGURG</B>

signals for events on file descriptor
<I>fd</I>.

Process IDs are returned as positive values;
process group IDs are returned as negative values (but see BUGS below).
<DT><B>F_SETOWN</B>

<DD>
Set the process ID or process group ID that will receive
<B>SIGIO</B>

and
<B>SIGURG</B>

signals for events on file descriptor
<I>fd</I>.

A process ID is specified as a positive value;
a process group ID is specified as a negative value.
Most commonly, the calling process specifies itself as the owner
(that is,
<I>arg</I>

is specified as
<B><A HREF="../man2/getpid.2.html">getpid</A></B>(2)).

<P>

If you set the
<B>O_ASYNC</B>

status flag on a file descriptor by using the
<B>F_SETFL</B>

command of
<B>fcntl</B>(),

a
<B>SIGIO</B>

signal is sent whenever input or output becomes possible
on that file descriptor.
<B>F_SETSIG</B>

can be used to obtain delivery of a signal other than
<B>SIGIO</B>.

If this permission check fails, then the signal is
silently discarded.
<P>
Sending a signal to the owner process (group) specified by
<B>F_SETOWN</B>

is subject to the same permissions checks as are described for
<B><A HREF="../man2/kill.2.html">kill</A></B>(2),

where the sending process is the one that employs
<B>F_SETOWN</B>

(but see BUGS below).
<P>
If the file descriptor
<I>fd</I>

refers to a socket,
<B>F_SETOWN</B>

also selects
the recipient of
<B>SIGURG</B>

signals that are delivered when out-of-band
data arrives on that socket.
(<B>SIGURG</B>

is sent in any situation where
<B><A HREF="../man2/select.2.html">select</A></B>(2)

would report the socket as having an &quot;exceptional condition&quot;.)










<P>
If a non-zero value is given to
<B>F_SETSIG</B>

in a multi-threaded process running with a threading library
that supports thread groups (e.g., NPTL),
then a positive value given to
<B>F_SETOWN</B>

has a different meaning:


instead of being a process ID identifying a whole process,
it is a thread ID identifying a specific thread within a process.
Consequently, it may be necessary to pass
<B>F_SETOWN</B>

the result of
<B><A HREF="../man2/gettid.2.html">gettid</A></B>(2)

instead of
<B><A HREF="../man2/getpid.2.html">getpid</A></B>(2)

to get sensible results when
<B>F_SETSIG</B>

is used.
(In current Linux threading implementations,
a main thread's thread ID is the same as its process ID.
This means that a single-threaded program can equally use
<B><A HREF="../man2/gettid.2.html">gettid</A></B>(2)

or
<B><A HREF="../man2/getpid.2.html">getpid</A></B>(2)

in this scenario.)
Note, however, that the statements in this paragraph do not apply
to the
<B>SIGURG</B>

signal generated for out-of-band data on a socket:
this signal is always sent to either a process or a process group,
depending on the value given to
<B>F_SETOWN</B>.





Note also that Linux imposes a limit on the
number of real-time signals that may be queued to a
process (see
<B><A HREF="../man2/getrlimit.2.html">getrlimit</A></B>(2)

and
<B><A HREF="../man7/signal.7.html">signal</A></B>(7))

and if this limit is reached, then the kernel reverts to
delivering
<B>SIGIO</B>,

and this signal is delivered to the entire
process rather than to a specific thread.

<DT><B>F_GETSIG</B>

<DD>
Get the signal sent when input or output becomes possible.
A value of zero means
<B>SIGIO</B>

is sent.
Any other value (including
<B>SIGIO</B>)

is the
signal sent instead, and in this case additional info is available to
the signal handler if installed with
<B>SA_SIGINFO</B>.

<DT><B>F_SETSIG</B>

<DD>
Sets the signal sent when input or output becomes possible.
A value of zero means to send the default
<B>SIGIO</B>

signal.
Any other value (including
<B>SIGIO</B>)

is the signal to send instead, and in this case additional info
is available to the signal handler if installed with
<B>SA_SIGINFO</B>.

<P>
Additionally, passing a non-zero value to
<B>F_SETSIG</B>

changes the signal recipient from a whole process to a specific thread
within a process.
See the description of
<B>F_SETOWN</B>

for more details.
<P>
By using
<B>F_SETSIG</B>

with a non-zero value, and setting
<B>SA_SIGINFO</B>

for the
signal handler (see
<B><A HREF="../man2/sigaction.2.html">sigaction</A></B>(2)),

extra information about I/O events is passed to
the handler in a
<I>siginfo_t</I>

structure.
If the
<I>si_code</I>

field indicates the source is
<B>SI_SIGIO</B>,

the
<I>si_fd</I>

field gives the file descriptor associated with the event.
Otherwise,
there is no indication which file descriptors are pending, and you
should use the usual mechanisms
(<B><A HREF="../man2/select.2.html">select</A></B>(2),

<B><A HREF="../man2/poll.2.html">poll</A></B>(2),

<B><A HREF="../man2/read.2.html">read</A></B>(2)

with
<B>O_NONBLOCK</B>

set etc.) to determine which file descriptors are available for I/O.
<P>
By selecting a real time signal (value &gt;=
<B>SIGRTMIN</B>),

multiple I/O events may be queued using the same signal numbers.
(Queuing is dependent on available memory).
Extra information is available
if
<B>SA_SIGINFO</B>

is set for the signal handler, as above.
</DL>
<P>

Using these mechanisms, a program can implement fully asynchronous I/O
without using
<B><A HREF="../man2/select.2.html">select</A></B>(2)

or
<B><A HREF="../man2/poll.2.html">poll</A></B>(2)

most of the time.
<P>

The use of
<B>O_ASYNC</B>,

<B>F_GETOWN</B>,

<B>F_SETOWN</B>

is specific to BSD and Linux.
<B>F_GETSIG</B>

and
<B>F_SETSIG</B>

are Linux-specific.
POSIX has asynchronous I/O and the
<I>aio_sigevent</I>

structure to achieve similar things; these are also available
in Linux as part of the GNU C Library (Glibc).
<A NAME="lbAK">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Leases</H3>

<B>F_SETLEASE</B>

and
<B>F_GETLEASE</B>

(Linux 2.4 onwards) are used (respectively) to establish a new lease,
and retrieve the current lease, on the open file description
referred to by the file descriptor
<I>fd</I>.

A file lease provides a mechanism whereby the process holding
the lease (the &quot;lease holder&quot;) is notified (via delivery of a signal)
when a process (the &quot;lease breaker&quot;) tries to
<B><A HREF="../man2/open.2.html">open</A></B>(2)

or
<B><A HREF="../man2/truncate.2.html">truncate</A></B>(2)

the file referred to by that file descriptor.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>F_SETLEASE</B>

<DD>
Set or remove a file lease according to which of the following
values is specified in the integer
<I>arg</I>:

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>F_RDLCK</B>

<DD>
Take out a read lease.
This will cause the calling process to be notified when
the file is opened for writing or is truncated.


A read lease can only be placed on a file descriptor that
is opened read-only.
<DT><B>F_WRLCK</B>

<DD>
Take out a write lease.
This will cause the caller to be notified when
the file is opened for reading or writing or is truncated.
A write lease may be placed on a file only if there are no
other open file descriptors for the file.
<DT><B>F_UNLCK</B>

<DD>
Remove our lease from the file.
</DL>
</DL>

</DL>
<P>

Leases are associated with an open file description (see
<B><A HREF="../man2/open.2.html">open</A></B>(2)).

This means that duplicate file descriptors (created by, for example,
<B><A HREF="../man2/fork.2.html">fork</A></B>(2)

or
<B><A HREF="../man2/dup.2.html">dup</A></B>(2))

refer to the same lease, and this lease may be modified
or released using any of these descriptors.
Furthermore, the lease is released by either an explicit
<B>F_UNLCK</B>

operation on any of these duplicate descriptors, or when all
such descriptors have been closed.
<P>

Leases may only be taken out on regular files.
An unprivileged process may only take out a lease on a file whose
UID (owner) matches the file system UID of the process.
A process with the
<B>CAP_LEASE</B>

capability may take out leases on arbitrary files.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>F_GETLEASE</B>

<DD>
Indicates what type of lease is associated with the file descriptor
<I>fd</I>

by returning either
<B>F_RDLCK</B>, <B>F_WRLCK</B>, or <B>F_UNLCK</B>,

indicating, respectively, a read lease , a write lease, or no lease.
(The third argument to
<B>fcntl</B>()

is omitted.)
</DL>
<P>

When a process (the &quot;lease breaker&quot;) performs an
<B><A HREF="../man2/open.2.html">open</A></B>(2)

or
<B><A HREF="../man2/truncate.2.html">truncate</A></B>(2)

that conflicts with a lease established via
<B>F_SETLEASE</B>,

the system call is blocked by the kernel and
the kernel notifies the lease holder by sending it a signal
(<B>SIGIO</B>

by default).
The lease holder should respond to receipt of this signal by doing
whatever cleanup is required in preparation for the file to be
accessed by another process (e.g., flushing cached buffers) and
then either remove or downgrade its lease.
A lease is removed by performing an
<B>F_SETLEASE</B>

command specifying
<I>arg</I>

as
<B>F_UNLCK</B>.

If the lease holder currently holds a write lease on the file,
and the lease breaker is opening the file for reading,
then it is sufficient for the lease holder to downgrade
the lease to a read lease.
This is done by performing an
<B>F_SETLEASE</B>

command specifying
<I>arg</I>

as
<B>F_RDLCK</B>.

<P>
If the lease holder fails to downgrade or remove the lease within
the number of seconds specified in
<I>/proc/sys/fs/lease-break-time</I>

then the kernel forcibly removes or downgrades the lease holder's lease.
<P>
Once the lease has been voluntarily or forcibly removed or downgraded,
and assuming the lease breaker has not unblocked its system call,
the kernel permits the lease breaker's system call to proceed.
<P>
If the lease breaker's blocked
<B><A HREF="../man2/open.2.html">open</A></B>(2)

or
<B><A HREF="../man2/truncate.2.html">truncate</A></B>(2)

is interrupted by a signal handler,
then the system call fails with the error
<B>EINTR</B>,

but the other steps still occur as described above.
If the lease breaker is killed by a signal while blocked in
<B><A HREF="../man2/open.2.html">open</A></B>(2)

or
<B><A HREF="../man2/truncate.2.html">truncate</A></B>(2),

then the other steps still occur as described above.
If the lease breaker specifies the
<B>O_NONBLOCK</B>

flag when calling
<B><A HREF="../man2/open.2.html">open</A></B>(2),

then the call immediately fails with the error
<B>EWOULDBLOCK</B>,

but the other steps still occur as described above.
<P>
The default signal used to notify the lease holder is
<B>SIGIO</B>,

but this can be changed using the
<B>F_SETSIG</B>

command to
<B>fcntl</B>().

If a
<B>F_SETSIG</B>

command is performed (even one specifying
<B>SIGIO</B>),

and the signal
handler is established using
<B>SA_SIGINFO</B>,

then the handler will receive a
<I>siginfo_t</I>

structure as its second argument, and the
<I>si_fd</I>

field of this argument will hold the descriptor of the leased file
that has been accessed by another process.
(This is useful if the caller holds leases against multiple files).
<A NAME="lbAL">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>File and directory change notification (dnotify)</H3>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>F_NOTIFY</B>

<DD>
(Linux 2.4 onwards)
Provide notification when the directory referred to by
<I>fd</I>

or any of the files that it contains is changed.
The events to be notified are specified in
<I>arg</I>,

which is a bit mask specified by ORing together zero or more of
the following bits:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>DN_ACCESS</B>

<DD>
A file was accessed (read, pread, readv)
<DT><B>DN_MODIFY</B>

<DD>
A file was modified (write, pwrite, writev, truncate, ftruncate).
<DT><B>DN_CREATE</B>

<DD>
A file was created (open, creat, mknod, mkdir, link, symlink, rename).
<DT><B>DN_DELETE</B>

<DD>
A file was unlinked (unlink, rename to another directory, rmdir).
<DT><B>DN_RENAME</B>

<DD>
A file was renamed within this directory (rename).
<DT><B>DN_ATTRIB</B>

<DD>
The attributes of a file were changed (chown, chmod, utime[s]).

</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
(In order to obtain these definitions, the
<B>_GNU_SOURCE</B>

feature test macro must be defined.)
<P>
Directory notifications are normally &quot;one-shot&quot;, and the application
must re-register to receive further notifications.
Alternatively, if
<B>DN_MULTISHOT</B>

is included in
<I>arg</I>,

then notification will remain in effect until explicitly removed.
<P>

A series of
<B>F_NOTIFY</B>

requests is cumulative, with the events in
<I>arg</I>

being added to the set already monitored.
To disable notification of all events, make an
<B>F_NOTIFY</B>

call specifying
<I>arg</I>

as 0.
<P>
Notification occurs via delivery of a signal.
The default signal is
<B>SIGIO</B>,

but this can be changed using the
<B>F_SETSIG</B>

command to
<B>fcntl</B>().

In the latter case, the signal handler receives a
<I>siginfo_t</I>

structure as its second argument (if the handler was
established using
<B>SA_SIGINFO</B>)

and the
<I>si_fd</I>

field of this structure contains the file descriptor which
generated the notification (useful when establishing notification
on multiple directories).
<P>
Especially when using
<B>DN_MULTISHOT</B>,

a real time signal should be used for notification,
so that multiple notifications can be queued.
<P>
<B>NOTE:</B>

New applications should consider using the
<I>inotify</I>

interface (available since kernel 2.6.13),
which provides a superior interface for obtaining notifications of
file system events.
See
<B><A HREF="../man7/inotify.7.html">inotify</A></B>(7).

<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

For a successful call, the return value depends on the operation:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>F_DUPFD</B>

<DD>
The new descriptor.
<DT><B>F_GETFD</B>

<DD>
Value of flags.
<DT><B>F_GETFL</B>

<DD>
Value of flags.
<DT><B>F_GETLEASE</B>

<DD>
Type of lease held on file descriptor.
<DT><B>F_GETOWN</B>

<DD>
Value of descriptor owner.
<DT><B>F_GETSIG</B>

<DD>
Value of signal sent when read or write becomes possible, or zero
for traditional
<B>SIGIO</B>

behavior.
<DT>All other commands<DD>
Zero.
</DL>
<P>

On error, -1 is returned, and
<I>errno</I>

is set appropriately.
<A NAME="lbAN">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EACCES</B> or <B>EAGAIN</B>

<DD>
Operation is prohibited by locks held by other processes.
<DT><B>EAGAIN</B>

<DD>
The operation is prohibited because the file has been memory-mapped by
another process.
<DT><B>EBADF</B>

<DD>
<I>fd</I>

is not an open file descriptor, or the command was
<B>F_SETLK</B>

or
<B>F_SETLKW</B>

and the file descriptor open mode doesn't match with the
type of lock requested.
<DT><B>EDEADLK</B>

<DD>
It was detected that the specified
<B>F_SETLKW</B>

command would cause a deadlock.
<DT><B>EFAULT</B>

<DD>
<I>lock</I>

is outside your accessible address space.
<DT><B>EINTR</B>

<DD>
For
<B>F_SETLKW</B>,

the command was interrupted by a signal; see
<B><A HREF="../man7/signal.7.html">signal</A></B>(7).

For
<B>F_GETLK</B> and <B>F_SETLK</B>,

the command was interrupted by a signal before the lock was checked or
acquired.
Most likely when locking a remote file (e.g., locking over
NFS), but can sometimes happen locally.
<DT><B>EINVAL</B>

<DD>
For
<B>F_DUPFD</B>,

<I>arg</I>

is negative or is greater than the maximum allowable value.
For
<B>F_SETSIG</B>,

<I>arg</I>

is not an allowable signal number.
<DT><B>EMFILE</B>

<DD>
For
<B>F_DUPFD</B>,

the process already has the maximum number of file descriptors open.
<DT><B>ENOLCK</B>

<DD>
Too many segment locks open, lock table is full, or a remote locking
protocol failed (e.g., locking over NFS).
<DT><B>EPERM</B>

<DD>
Attempted to clear the
<B>O_APPEND</B>

flag on a file that has the append-only attribute set.

<H2>NOTES</H2>

The errors returned by
<B><A HREF="../man2/dup2.2.html">dup2</A></B>(2)

are different from those returned by
<B>F_DUPFD</B>.

<P>
Since kernel 2.0, there is no interaction between the types of lock
placed by
<B><A HREF="../man2/flock.2.html">flock</A></B>(2)

and
<B>fcntl</B>().

<P>
POSIX.1-2001 allows
<I>l_len</I>

to be negative.
(And if it is, the interval described by the lock
covers bytes
<I>l_start</I>+<I>l_len</I>

up to and including
<I>l_start</I>-1.)

This is supported by Linux since Linux 2.4.21 and 2.5.49.
<P>
Several systems have more fields in
<I>struct flock</I>

such as, for example,
<I>l_sysid</I>.



Clearly,
<I>l_pid</I>

alone is not going to be very useful if the process holding the lock
may live on a different machine.
<A NAME="lbAQ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>BUGS</H2>

A limitation of the Linux system call conventions on some
architectures (notably i386) means that if a (negative)
process group ID to be returned by
<B>F_GETOWN</B>

falls in the range -1 to -4095, then the return value is wrongly
interpreted by glibc as an error in the system call;

that is, the return value of
<B>fcntl</B>()

will be -1, and
<I>errno</I>

will contain the (positive) process group ID.




<P>
In Linux 2.4 and earlier, there is bug that can occur
when an unprivileged process uses
<B>F_SETOWN</B>

to specify the owner
of a socket file descriptor
as a process (group) other than the caller.
In this case,
<B>fcntl</B>()

can return -1 with
<I>errno</I>

set to
<B>EPERM</B>,

even when the owner process (group) is one that the caller
has permission to send signals to.
Despite this error return, the file descriptor owner is set,
and signals will be sent to the owner.
<P>
The implementation of mandatory locking in all known versions of Linux
is subject to race conditions which render it unreliable:

a
<B><A HREF="../man2/write.2.html">write</A></B>(2)

call that overlaps with a lock may modify data after the mandatory lock is
acquired;
a
<B><A HREF="../man2/read.2.html">read</A></B>(2)

call that overlaps with a lock may detect changes to data that were made
only after a write lock was acquired.
Similar races exist between mandatory locks and
<B><A HREF="../man2/mmap.2.html">mmap</A></B>(2).

It is therefore inadvisable to rely on mandatory locking.
