<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<PRE>
<B>#include &lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/unistd.h">unistd.h</A>&gt;</B>

</PRE>

<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B>fcntl</B>()

performs one of the operations described below on the open file descriptor
<I>fd</I>.

The operation is determined by
<I>cmd</I>.

<P>

<B>fcntl</B>()

can take an optional third argument.
Whether or not this argument is required is determined by
<I>cmd</I>.

The required argument type is indicated in parentheses after each
<I>cmd</I>

name (in most cases, the required type is
<I>int</I>,

and we identify the argument using the name
<I>arg</I>),

or
<I>void</I>

is specified if the argument is not required.
<P>

Certain of the operations below are supported only since a particular
Linux kernel version.
The preferred method of checking whether the host kernel supports
a particular operation is to invoke
<B>fcntl</B>()

with the desired
<I>cmd</I>

value and then test whether the call failed with
<B>EINVAL</B>,

indicating that the kernel does not recognize this value.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Duplicating a file descriptor</H3>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>F_DUPFD</B> (<I>int</I>)

<DD>
Duplicate the file descriptor
<I>fd</I>

using the lowest-numbered available file descriptor greater than or equal to
<I>arg</I>.

This is different from
<B><A HREF="../man2/dup2.2.html">dup2</A></B>(2),

which uses exactly the file descriptor specified.
<DT><DD>
On success, the new file descriptor is returned.
<DT><DD>
See
<B><A HREF="../man2/dup.2.html">dup</A></B>(2)

for further details.
<DT><B>F_DUPFD_CLOEXEC</B> (<I>int</I>; since Linux 2.6.24)

<DD>
As for
<B>F_DUPFD</B>,

but additionally set the
close-on-exec flag for the duplicate file descriptor.
Specifying this flag permits a program to avoid an additional
<B>fcntl</B>()

<B>F_SETFD</B>

operation to set the
<B>FD_CLOEXEC</B>

flag.
For an explanation of why this flag is useful,
see the description of
<B>O_CLOEXEC</B>

in
<B><A HREF="../man2/open.2.html">open</A></B>(2).

</DL>
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>File descriptor flags</H3>

The following commands manipulate the flags associated with
a file descriptor.
Currently, only one such flag is defined:
<B>FD_CLOEXEC</B>,

the close-on-exec flag.
If the
<B>FD_CLOEXEC</B>

bit is set,
the file descriptor will automatically be closed during a successful
<B><A HREF="../man2/execve.2.html">execve</A></B>(2).

(If the
<B><A HREF="../man2/execve.2.html">execve</A></B>(2)

fails, the file descriptor is left open.)
If the
<B>FD_CLOEXEC</B>

bit is not set, the file descriptor will remain open across an
<B><A HREF="../man2/execve.2.html">execve</A></B>(2).

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>F_GETFD</B> (<I>void</I>)

<DD>
Return (as the function result) the file descriptor flags;
<I>arg</I>

is ignored.
<DT><B>F_SETFD</B> (<I>int</I>)

<DD>
Set the file descriptor flags to the value specified by
<I>arg</I>.

</DL>
<P>

In multithreaded programs, using
<B>fcntl</B>()

<B>F_SETFD</B>

to set the close-on-exec flag at the same time as another thread performs a
<B><A HREF="../man2/fork.2.html">fork</A></B>(2)

plus
<B><A HREF="../man2/execve.2.html">execve</A></B>(2)

is vulnerable to a race condition that may unintentionally leak
the file descriptor to the program executed in the child process.
See the discussion of the
<B>O_CLOEXEC</B>

flag in
<B><A HREF="../man2/open.2.html">open</A></B>(2)

for details and a remedy to the problem.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>File status flags</H3>

Each open file description has certain associated status flags,
initialized by
<B><A HREF="../man2/open.2.html">open</A></B>(2)



and possibly modified by
<B>fcntl</B>().

Duplicated file descriptors
(made with
<B><A HREF="../man2/dup.2.html">dup</A></B>(2),

<B>fcntl</B>(F_DUPFD),

<B><A HREF="../man2/fork.2.html">fork</A></B>(2),

etc.) refer to the same open file description, and thus
share the same file status flags.
<P>

The file status flags and their semantics are described in
<B><A HREF="../man2/open.2.html">open</A></B>(2).

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>F_GETFL</B> (<I>void</I>)

<DD>
Return (as the function result)
the file access mode and the file status flags;
<I>arg</I>

is ignored.
<DT><B>F_SETFL</B> (<I>int</I>)

<DD>
Set the file status flags to the value specified by
<I>arg</I>.

File access mode
(<B>O_RDONLY</B>, <B>O_WRONLY</B>, <B>O_RDWR</B>)

and file creation flags
(i.e.,
<B>O_CREAT</B>, <B>O_EXCL</B>, <B>O_NOCTTY</B>, <B>O_TRUNC</B>)

in
<I>arg</I>

are ignored.
On Linux, this command can change only the
<B>O_APPEND</B>,

<B>O_ASYNC</B>,

<B>O_DIRECT</B>,

<B>O_NOATIME</B>,

and
<B>O_NONBLOCK</B>

flags.
It is not possible to change the
<B>O_DSYNC</B>

and
<B>O_SYNC</B>

flags; see BUGS, below.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Advisory record locking</H3>

Linux implements traditional (&quot;process-associated&quot;) UNIX record locks,
as standardized by POSIX.
For a Linux-specific alternative with better semantics,
see the discussion of open file description locks below.
<P>

<B>F_SETLK</B>,

<B>F_SETLKW</B>,

and
<B>F_GETLK</B>

are used to acquire, release, and test for the existence of record
locks (also known as byte-range, file-segment, or file-region locks).
The third argument,
<I>lock</I>,

is a pointer to a structure that has at least the following fields
(in unspecified order).
<P>



struct flock {
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;short&nbsp;l_type;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/*&nbsp;Type&nbsp;of&nbsp;lock:&nbsp;F_RDLCK,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;F_WRLCK,&nbsp;F_UNLCK&nbsp;*/
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;short&nbsp;l_whence;&nbsp;&nbsp;/*&nbsp;How&nbsp;to&nbsp;interpret&nbsp;l_start:
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SEEK_SET,&nbsp;SEEK_CUR,&nbsp;SEEK_END&nbsp;*/
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;off_t&nbsp;l_start;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/*&nbsp;Starting&nbsp;offset&nbsp;for&nbsp;lock&nbsp;*/
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;off_t&nbsp;l_len;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/*&nbsp;Number&nbsp;of&nbsp;bytes&nbsp;to&nbsp;lock&nbsp;*/
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pid_t&nbsp;l_pid;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/*&nbsp;PID&nbsp;of&nbsp;process&nbsp;blocking&nbsp;our&nbsp;lock
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(set&nbsp;by&nbsp;F_GETLK&nbsp;and&nbsp;F_OFD_GETLK)&nbsp;*/
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...
};


<P>

The
<I>l_whence</I>, <I>l_start</I>, and <I>l_len</I>

fields of this structure specify the range of bytes we wish to lock.
Bytes past the end of the file may be locked,
but not bytes before the start of the file.
<P>

<I>l_start</I>

is the starting offset for the lock, and is interpreted
relative to either:
the start of the file (if
<I>l_whence</I>

is
<B>SEEK_SET</B>);

the current file offset (if
<I>l_whence</I>

is
<B>SEEK_CUR</B>);

or the end of the file (if
<I>l_whence</I>

is
<B>SEEK_END</B>).

In the final two cases,
<I>l_start</I>

can be a negative number provided the
offset does not lie before the start of the file.
<P>

<I>l_len</I>

specifies the number of bytes to be locked.
If
<I>l_len</I>

is positive, then the range to be locked covers bytes
<I>l_start</I>

up to and including
<I>l_start</I>+<I>l_len</I>-1.

Specifying 0 for
<I>l_len</I>

has the special meaning: lock all bytes starting at the
location specified by
<I>l_whence</I> and <I>l_start</I>

through to the end of file, no matter how large the file grows.
<P>

POSIX.1-2001 allows (but does not require)
an implementation to support a negative
<I>l_len</I>

value; if
<I>l_len</I>

is negative, the interval described by
<I>lock</I>

covers bytes
<I>l_start</I>+<I>l_len</I>

up to and including
<I>l_start</I>-1.

This is supported by Linux since kernel versions 2.4.21 and 2.5.49.
<P>

The
<I>l_type</I>

field can be used to place a read
(<B>F_RDLCK</B>)

or a write
(<B>F_WRLCK</B>)

lock on a file.
Any number of processes may hold a read lock (shared lock)
on a file region, but only one process may hold a write lock
(exclusive lock).
An exclusive lock excludes all other locks,
both shared and exclusive.
A single process can hold only one type of lock on a file region;
if a new lock is applied to an already-locked region,
then the existing lock is converted to the new lock type.
(Such conversions may involve splitting, shrinking, or coalescing with
an existing lock if the byte range specified by the new lock does not
precisely coincide with the range of the existing lock.)
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>F_SETLK</B> (<I>struct flock *</I>)

<DD>
Acquire a lock (when
<I>l_type</I>

is
<B>F_RDLCK</B>

or
<B>F_WRLCK</B>)

or release a lock (when
<I>l_type</I>

is
<B>F_UNLCK</B>)

on the bytes specified by the
<I>l_whence</I>, <I>l_start</I>, and <I>l_len</I>

fields of
<I>lock</I>.

If a conflicting lock is held by another process,
this call returns -1 and sets
<I>errno</I>

to
<B>EACCES</B>

or
<B>EAGAIN</B>.

(The error returned in this case differs across implementations,
so POSIX requires a portable application to check for both errors.)
<DT><B>F_SETLKW</B> (<I>struct flock *</I>)

<DD>
As for
<B>F_SETLK</B>,

but if a conflicting lock is held on the file, then wait for that
lock to be released.
If a signal is caught while waiting, then the call is interrupted
and (after the signal handler has returned)
returns immediately (with return value -1 and
<I>errno</I>

set to
<B>EINTR</B>;

see
<B><A HREF="../man7/signal.7.html">signal</A></B>(7)).

<DT><B>F_GETLK</B> (<I>struct flock *</I>)

<DD>
On input to this call,
<I>lock</I>

describes a lock we would like to place on the file.
If the lock could be placed,
<B>fcntl</B>()

does not actually place it, but returns
<B>F_UNLCK</B>

in the
<I>l_type</I>

field of
<I>lock</I>

and leaves the other fields of the structure unchanged.
<DT><DD>
If one or more incompatible locks would prevent
this lock being placed, then
<B>fcntl</B>()

returns details about one of those locks in the
<I>l_type</I>, <I>l_whence</I>, <I>l_start</I>, and <I>l_len</I>

fields of
<I>lock</I>.

If the conflicting lock is a traditional (process-associated) record lock,
then the
<I>l_pid</I>

field is set to the PID of the process holding that lock.
If the conflicting lock is an open file description lock, then
<I>l_pid</I>

is set to -1.
Note that the returned information
may already be out of date by the time the caller inspects it.
</DL>
<P>

In order to place a read lock,
<I>fd</I>

must be open for reading.
In order to place a write lock,
<I>fd</I>

must be open for writing.
To place both types of lock, open a file read-write.
<P>

When placing locks with
<B>F_SETLKW</B>,

the kernel detects
<I>deadlocks</I>,

whereby two or more processes have their
lock requests mutually blocked by locks held by the other processes.
For example, suppose process A holds a write lock on byte 100 of a file,
and process B holds a write lock on byte 200.
If each process then attempts to lock the byte already
locked by the other process using
<B>F_SETLKW</B>,

then, without deadlock detection,
both processes would remain blocked indefinitely.
When the kernel detects such deadlocks,
it causes one of the blocking lock requests to immediately fail with the error
<B>EDEADLK</B>;

an application that encounters such an error should release
some of its locks to allow other applications to proceed before
attempting regain the locks that it requires.
Circular deadlocks involving more than two processes are also detected.
Note, however, that there are limitations to the kernel's
deadlock-detection algorithm; see BUGS.
<P>

As well as being removed by an explicit
<B>F_UNLCK</B>,

record locks are automatically released when the process terminates.
<P>

Record locks are not inherited by a child created via
<B><A HREF="../man2/fork.2.html">fork</A></B>(2),

but are preserved across an
<B><A HREF="../man2/execve.2.html">execve</A></B>(2).

<P>

Because of the buffering performed by the
<B><A HREF="../man3/stdio.3.html">stdio</A></B>(3)

library, the use of record locking with routines in that package
should be avoided; use
<B><A HREF="../man2/read.2.html">read</A></B>(2)

and
<B><A HREF="../man2/write.2.html">write</A></B>(2)

instead.
<P>

The record locks described above are associated with the process
(unlike the open file description locks described below).
This has some unfortunate consequences:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
If a process closes
<I>any</I>

file descriptor referring to a file,
then all of the process's locks on that file are released,
regardless of the file descriptor(s) on which the locks were obtained.



This is bad: it means that a process can lose its locks on
a file such as
<I>/etc/passwd</I>

or
<I>/etc/mtab</I>

when for some reason a library function decides to open, read,
and close the same file.
<DT>*<DD>
The threads in a process share locks.
In other words,
a multithreaded program can't use record locking to ensure
that threads don't simultaneously access the same region of a file.
</DL>
<P>

Open file description locks solve both of these problems.
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Open file description locks (non-POSIX)</H3>

Open file description locks are advisory byte-range locks whose operation is
in most respects identical to the traditional record locks described above.
This lock type is Linux-specific,
and available since Linux 3.15.
(There is a proposal with the Austin Group


to include this lock type in the next revision of POSIX.1.)
For an explanation of open file descriptions, see
<B><A HREF="../man2/open.2.html">open</A></B>(2).

<P>

The principal difference between the two lock types
is that whereas traditional record locks
are associated with a process,
open file description locks are associated with the
open file description on which they are acquired,
much like locks acquired with
<B><A HREF="../man2/flock.2.html">flock</A></B>(2).

Consequently (and unlike traditional advisory record locks),
open file description locks are inherited across
<B><A HREF="../man2/fork.2.html">fork</A></B>(2)

(and
<B><A HREF="../man2/clone.2.html">clone</A></B>(2)

with
<B>CLONE_FILES</B>),

and are only automatically released on the last close
of the open file description,
instead of being released on any close of the file.
<P>

Conflicting lock combinations
(i.e., a read lock and a write lock or two write locks)
where one lock is an open file description lock and the other
is a traditional record lock conflict
even when they are acquired by the same process on the same file descriptor.
<P>

Open file description locks placed via the same open file description
(i.e., via the same file descriptor,
or via a duplicate of the file descriptor created by
<B><A HREF="../man2/fork.2.html">fork</A></B>(2),

<B><A HREF="../man2/dup.2.html">dup</A></B>(2),

<B>fcntl</B>()

<B>F_DUPFD</B>,

and so on) are always compatible:
if a new lock is placed on an already locked region,
then the existing lock is converted to the new lock type.
(Such conversions may result in splitting, shrinking, or coalescing with
an existing lock as discussed above.)
<P>

On the other hand, open file description locks may conflict with
each other when they are acquired via different open file descriptions.
Thus, the threads in a multithreaded program can use
open file description locks to synchronize access to a file region
by having each thread perform its own
<B><A HREF="../man2/open.2.html">open</A></B>(2)

on the file and applying locks via the resulting file descriptor.
<P>

As with traditional advisory locks, the third argument to
<B>fcntl</B>(),

<I>lock</I>,

is a pointer to an
<I>flock</I>

structure.
By contrast with traditional record locks, the
<I>l_pid</I>

field of that structure must be set to zero
when using the commands described below.
<P>

The commands for working with open file description locks are analogous
to those used with traditional locks:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>F_OFD_SETLK</B> (<I>struct flock *</I>)

<DD>
Acquire an open file description lock (when
<I>l_type</I>

is
<B>F_RDLCK</B>

or
<B>F_WRLCK</B>)

or release an open file description lock (when
<I>l_type</I>

is
<B>F_UNLCK</B>)

on the bytes specified by the
<I>l_whence</I>, <I>l_start</I>, and <I>l_len</I>

fields of
<I>lock</I>.

If a conflicting lock is held by another process,
this call returns -1 and sets
<I>errno</I>

to
<B>EAGAIN</B>.

<DT><B>F_OFD_SETLKW</B> (<I>struct flock *</I>)

<DD>
As for
<B>F_OFD_SETLK</B>,

but if a conflicting lock is held on the file, then wait for that lock to be
released.
If a signal is caught while waiting, then the call is interrupted
and (after the signal handler has returned) returns immediately
(with return value -1 and
<I>errno</I>

set to
<B>EINTR</B>;

see
<B><A HREF="../man7/signal.7.html">signal</A></B>(7)).

<DT><B>F_OFD_GETLK</B> (<I>struct flock *</I>)

<DD>
On input to this call,
<I>lock</I>

describes an open file description lock we would like to place on the file.
If the lock could be placed,
<B>fcntl</B>()

does not actually place it, but returns
<B>F_UNLCK</B>

in the
<I>l_type</I>

field of
<I>lock</I>

and leaves the other fields of the structure unchanged.
If one or more incompatible locks would prevent this lock being placed,
then details about one of these locks are returned via
<I>lock</I>,

as described above for
<B>F_GETLK</B>.

</DL>
<P>

In the current implementation,

no deadlock detection is performed for open file description locks.
(This contrasts with process-associated record locks,
for which the kernel does perform deadlock detection.)

<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Mandatory locking</H3>

<I>Warning</I>:

the Linux implementation of mandatory locking is unreliable.
See BUGS below.
Because of these bugs,
and the fact that the feature is believed to be little used,
since Linux 4.5, mandatory locking has been made an optional feature,
governed by a configuration option
(<B>CONFIG_MANDATORY_FILE_LOCKING</B>).

This is an initial step toward removing this feature completely.
<P>

By default, both traditional (process-associated) and open file description
record locks are advisory.
Advisory locks are not enforced and are useful only between
cooperating processes.
<P>

Both lock types can also be mandatory.
Mandatory locks are enforced for all processes.
If a process tries to perform an incompatible access (e.g.,
<B><A HREF="../man2/read.2.html">read</A></B>(2)

or
<B><A HREF="../man2/write.2.html">write</A></B>(2))

on a file region that has an incompatible mandatory lock,
then the result depends upon whether the
<B>O_NONBLOCK</B>

flag is enabled for its open file description.
If the
<B>O_NONBLOCK</B>

flag is not enabled, then
the system call is blocked until the lock is removed
or converted to a mode that is compatible with the access.
If the
<B>O_NONBLOCK</B>

flag is enabled, then the system call fails with the error
<B>EAGAIN</B>.

<P>

To make use of mandatory locks, mandatory locking must be enabled
both on the filesystem that contains the file to be locked,
and on the file itself.
Mandatory locking is enabled on a filesystem
using the &quot;-o mand&quot; option to
<B><A HREF="../man8/mount.8.html">mount</A></B>(8),

or the
<B>MS_MANDLOCK</B>

flag for
<B><A HREF="../man2/mount.2.html">mount</A></B>(2).

Mandatory locking is enabled on a file by disabling
group execute permission on the file and enabling the set-group-ID
permission bit (see
<B><A HREF="../man1/chmod.1.html">chmod</A></B>(1)

and
<B><A HREF="../man2/chmod.2.html">chmod</A></B>(2)).

<P>

Mandatory locking is not specified by POSIX.
Some other systems also support mandatory locking,
although the details of how to enable it vary across systems.

<A NAME="lbAK">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Lost locks</H3>

When an advisory lock is obtained on a networked filesystem such as
NFS it is possible that the lock might get lost.
This may happen due to administrative action on the server, or due to a
network partition (i.e., loss of network connectivity with the server)
which lasts long enough for the server to assume
that the client is no longer functioning.
<P>

When the filesystem determines that a lock has been lost, future
<B><A HREF="../man2/read.2.html">read</A></B>(2)

or
<B><A HREF="../man2/write.2.html">write</A></B>(2)

requests may fail with the error
<B>EIO</B>.

This error will persist until the lock is removed or the file
descriptor is closed.
Since Linux 3.12,

this happens at least for NFSv4 (including all minor versions).
<P>

Some versions of UNIX send a signal
(<B>SIGLOST</B>)

in this circumstance.
Linux does not define this signal, and does not provide any
asynchronous notification of lost locks.

Set the process ID or process group ID that will receive
<B>SIGIO</B>

and
<B>SIGURG</B>

signals for events on the file descriptor
<I>fd</I>.

The target process or process group ID is specified in
<I>arg</I>.

A process ID is specified as a positive value;
a process group ID is specified as a negative value.
Most commonly, the calling process specifies itself as the owner
(that is,
<I>arg</I>

is specified as
<B><A HREF="../man2/getpid.2.html">getpid</A></B>(2)).

<DT><DD>
As well as setting the file descriptor owner,
one must also enable generation of signals on the file descriptor.
This is done by using the
<B>fcntl</B>()

<B>F_SETFL</B>

command to set the
<B>O_ASYNC</B>

file status flag on the file descriptor.
Subsequently, a
<B>SIGIO</B>

signal is sent whenever input or output becomes possible
on the file descriptor.
The
<B>fcntl</B>()

<B>F_SETSIG</B>

command can be used to obtain delivery of a signal other than
<B>SIGIO</B>.

<DT><DD>
Sending a signal to the owner process (group) specified by
<B>F_SETOWN</B>

is subject to the same permissions checks as are described for
<B><A HREF="../man2/kill.2.html">kill</A></B>(2),

where the sending process is the one that employs
<B>F_SETOWN</B>

(but see BUGS below).
If this permission check fails, then the signal is
silently discarded.
<I>Note</I>:

The
<B>F_SETOWN</B>

operation records the caller's credentials at the time of the
<B>fcntl</B>()

call,
and it is these saved credentials that are used for the permission checks.
<DT><DD>
If the file descriptor
<I>fd</I>

refers to a socket,
<B>F_SETOWN</B>

also selects
the recipient of
<B>SIGURG</B>

signals that are delivered when out-of-band
data arrives on that socket.
(<B>SIGURG</B>

is sent in any situation where
<B><A HREF="../man2/select.2.html">select</A></B>(2)

would report the socket as having an &quot;exceptional condition&quot;.)

The following was true in 2.6.x kernels up to and including

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
If a nonzero value is given to
<B>F_SETSIG</B>

in a multithreaded process running with a threading library
that supports thread groups (e.g., NPTL),
then a positive value given to
<B>F_SETOWN</B>

has a different meaning:


instead of being a process ID identifying a whole process,
it is a thread ID identifying a specific thread within a process.
Consequently, it may be necessary to pass
<B>F_SETOWN</B>

the result of
<B><A HREF="../man2/gettid.2.html">gettid</A></B>(2)

instead of
<B><A HREF="../man2/getpid.2.html">getpid</A></B>(2)

to get sensible results when
<B>F_SETSIG</B>

is used.
(In current Linux threading implementations,
a main thread's thread ID is the same as its process ID.
This means that a single-threaded program can equally use
<B><A HREF="../man2/gettid.2.html">gettid</A></B>(2)

or
<B><A HREF="../man2/getpid.2.html">getpid</A></B>(2)

in this scenario.)
Note, however, that the statements in this paragraph do not apply
to the
<B>SIGURG</B>

signal generated for out-of-band data on a socket:
this signal is always sent to either a process or a process group,
depending on the value given to
<B>F_SETOWN</B>.

By using

with a nonzero value, and setting
<B>SA_SIGINFO</B>

for the
signal handler (see
<B><A HREF="../man2/sigaction.2.html">sigaction</A></B>(2)),

extra information about I/O events is passed to
the handler in a
<I>siginfo_t</I>

structure.
If the
<I>si_code</I>

field indicates the source is
<B>SI_SIGIO</B>,

the
<I>si_fd</I>

field gives the file descriptor associated with the event.
Otherwise,
there is no indication which file descriptors are pending, and you
should use the usual mechanisms
(<B><A HREF="../man2/select.2.html">select</A></B>(2),

<B><A HREF="../man2/poll.2.html">poll</A></B>(2),

<B><A HREF="../man2/read.2.html">read</A></B>(2)

with
<B>O_NONBLOCK</B>

set etc.) to determine which file descriptors are available for I/O.
<DT><DD>
Note that the file descriptor provided in
<I>si_fd</I>

is the one that was specified during the
<B>F_SETSIG</B>

operation.
This can lead to an unusual corner case.
If the file descriptor is duplicated
(<B><A HREF="../man2/dup.2.html">dup</A></B>(2)

or similar), and the original file descriptor is closed,
then I/O events will continue to be generated, but the
<I>si_fd</I>

field will contain the number of the now closed file descriptor.
<DT><DD>
By selecting a real time signal (value &gt;=
<B>SIGRTMIN</B>),

multiple I/O events may be queued using the same signal numbers.
(Queuing is dependent on available memory.)
Extra information is available
if
<B>SA_SIGINFO</B>

is set for the signal handler, as above.
<DT><DD>
Note that Linux imposes a limit on the
number of real-time signals that may be queued to a
process (see
<B><A HREF="../man2/getrlimit.2.html">getrlimit</A></B>(2)

and
<B><A HREF="../man7/signal.7.html">signal</A></B>(7))

and if this limit is reached, then the kernel reverts to
delivering
<B>SIGIO</B>,

and this signal is delivered to the entire
process rather than to a specific thread.

</DL>
<P>

Using these mechanisms, a program can implement fully asynchronous I/O
without using
<B><A HREF="../man2/select.2.html">select</A></B>(2)

or
<B><A HREF="../man2/poll.2.html">poll</A></B>(2)

most of the time.
<P>

The use of
<B>O_ASYNC</B>

is specific to BSD and Linux.
The only use of
<B>F_GETOWN</B>

A file lease provides a mechanism whereby the process holding
the lease (the &quot;lease holder&quot;) is notified (via delivery of a signal)
when a process (the &quot;lease breaker&quot;) tries to
<B><A HREF="../man2/open.2.html">open</A></B>(2)

Leases are associated with an open file description (see

operation on any of these duplicate file descriptors, or when all
such file descriptors have been closed.

or
<B><A HREF="../man2/truncate.2.html">truncate</A></B>(2)

that conflicts with a lease established via
<B>F_SETLEASE</B>,

the system call is blocked by the kernel and
the kernel notifies the lease holder by sending it a signal
(<B>SIGIO</B>

by default).
The lease holder should respond to receipt of this signal by doing
whatever cleanup is required in preparation for the file to be
accessed by another process (e.g., flushing cached buffers) and
then either remove or downgrade its lease.
A lease is removed by performing an
<B>F_SETLEASE</B>

command specifying
<I>arg</I>

as
<B>F_UNLCK</B>.

If the lease holder currently holds a write lease on the file,
and the lease breaker is opening the file for reading,
then it is sufficient for the lease holder to downgrade
the lease to a read lease.
This is done by performing an
<B>F_SETLEASE</B>

command specifying
<I>arg</I>

as
<B>F_RDLCK</B>.

<P>

If the lease holder fails to downgrade or remove the lease within
the number of seconds specified in
<I>/proc/sys/fs/lease-break-time</I>,

then the kernel forcibly removes or downgrades the lease holder's lease.

Once a lease break has been initiated,
<B>F_GETLEASE</B>

returns the target lease type (either
<B>F_RDLCK</B>

or

depending on what would be compatible with the lease breaker)
until the lease holder voluntarily downgrades or removes the lease or
the kernel forcibly does so after the lease break timer expires.
<P>

Once the lease has been voluntarily or forcibly removed or downgraded,
and assuming the lease breaker has not unblocked its system call,
the kernel permits the lease breaker's system call to proceed.

then the other steps still occur as described above.
If the lease breaker specifies the

<B><A HREF="../man2/open.2.html">open</A></B>(2),

then the call immediately fails with the error

If a

File seals limit the set of allowed operations on a given file.
For each seal that is set on a file,

<B><A HREF="../man2/truncate.2.html">truncate</A></B>(2)

and
<B><A HREF="../man2/ftruncate.2.html">ftruncate</A></B>(2).

Those calls fail with

if you try to shrink the file in question.
Increasing the file size is still possible.
<DT><B>F_SEAL_GROW</B>

<DD>
If this seal is set, the size of the file in question cannot be increased.
This affects

<B><A HREF="../man2/truncate.2.html">truncate</A></B>(2),

<B><A HREF="../man2/ftruncate.2.html">ftruncate</A></B>(2),

and
<B><A HREF="../man2/fallocate.2.html">fallocate</A></B>(2).

These calls fail with
<B>EPERM</B>

if you use them to increase the file size.
If you keep the size or shrink it, those calls still work as expected.
<DT><B>F_SEAL_WRITE</B>

<DD>
If this seal is set, you cannot modify the contents of the file.
Note that shrinking or growing the size of the file is
still possible and allowed.








Thus, this seal is normally used in combination with one of the other seals.
This seal affects
<B><A HREF="../man2/write.2.html">write</A></B>(2)

and
<B><A HREF="../man2/fallocate.2.html">fallocate</A></B>(2)

(only in combination with the
<B>FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE</B>

Those calls fail with
<B>EPERM</B>

if this seal is set.
Furthermore, trying to create new shared, writable memory-mappings via
<B><A HREF="../man2/mmap.2.html">mmap</A></B>(2)

will also fail with
<B>EPERM</B>.

<DT><DD>
Using the
<B>F_ADD_SEALS</B>

operation to set the
<B>F_SEAL_WRITE</B>

seal fails with
<B>EBUSY</B>

if any writable, shared mapping exists.
Such mappings must be unmapped before you can add this seal.
Furthermore, if there are any asynchronous I/O operations
(<B><A HREF="../man2/io_submit.2.html">io_submit</A></B>(2))

pending on the file,
all outstanding writes will be discarded.

<A NAME="lbAQ">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>File read/write hints</H3>

Write lifetime hints can be used to inform the kernel about the relative
expected lifetime of writes on a given inode or
via a particular open file description.
(See
<B><A HREF="../man2/open.2.html">open</A></B>(2)

for an explanation of open file descriptions.)
In this context, the term &quot;write lifetime&quot; means
the expected time the data will live on media, before
being overwritten or erased.
<P>

An application may use the different hint values specified below to
separate writes into different write classes,
so that multiple users or applications running on a single storage back-end
can aggregate their I/O patterns in a consistent manner.
However, there are no functional semantics implied by these flags,
and different I/O classes can use the write lifetime hints
in arbitrary ways, so long as the hints are used consistently.
<P>

The following operations can be applied to the file descriptor,
<I>fd</I>:

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>F_GET_RW_HINT</B> (<I>uint64_t *</I>; since Linux 4.13)

<DD>
Returns the value of the read/write hint associated with the underlying inode
referred to by
<I>fd</I>.

<DT><B>F_SET_RW_HINT</B> (<I>uint64_t *</I>; since Linux 4.13)

<DD>
Sets the read/write hint value associated with the
underlying inode referred to by
<I>fd</I>.

This hint persists until either it is explicitly modified or
the underlying filesystem is unmounted.
<DT><B>F_GET_FILE_RW_HINT</B> (<I>uint64_t *</I>; since Linux 4.13)

<DD>
Returns the value of the read/write hint associated with
the open file description referred to by
<I>fd</I>.

<DT><B>F_SET_FILE_RW_HINT</B> (<I>uint64_t *</I>; since Linux 4.13)

<DD>
Sets the read/write hint value associated with the open file description
referred to by
<I>fd</I>.

</DL>
<P>

If an open file description has not been assigned a read/write hint,
then it shall use the value assigned to the inode, if any.
<P>

The following read/write
hints are valid since Linux 4.13:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>RWH_WRITE_LIFE_NOT_SET</B>

<DD>
No specific hint has been set.
This is the default value.
<DT><B>RWH_WRITE_LIFE_NONE</B>

<DD>
No specific write lifetime is associated with this file or inode.
<DT><B>RWH_WRITE_LIFE_SHORT</B>

<DD>
Data written to this inode or via this open file description
is expected to have a short lifetime.
<DT><B>RWH_WRITE_LIFE_MEDIUM</B>

<DD>
Data written to this inode or via this open file description
is expected to have a lifetime longer than
data written with
<B>RWH_WRITE_LIFE_SHORT</B>.

<DT><B>RWH_WRITE_LIFE_LONG</B>

<DD>
Data written to this inode or via this open file description
is expected to have a lifetime longer than
data written with
<B>RWH_WRITE_LIFE_MEDIUM</B>.

<DT><B>RWH_WRITE_LIFE_EXTREME</B>

<DD>
Data written to this inode or via this open file description
is expected to have a lifetime longer than
data written with
<B>RWH_WRITE_LIFE_LONG</B>.

</DL>
<P>

All the write-specific hints are relative to each other,
and no individual absolute meaning should be attributed to them.

<H3>File locking</H3>

The original Linux
<B>fcntl</B>()

system call was not designed to handle large file offsets
(in the
<I>flock</I>

structure).
Consequently, an
<B>fcntl64</B>()

system call was added in Linux 2.4.
The newer system call employs a different structure for file locking,
<I>flock64</I>,

and corresponding commands,
<B>F_GETLK64</B>,

<B>F_SETLK64</B>,

and
<B>F_SETLKW64</B>.

However, these details can be ignored by applications using glibc, whose
<B>fcntl</B>()

wrapper function transparently employs the more recent system call
where it is available.

<A NAME="lbAW">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Record locks</H3>

Since kernel 2.0, there is no interaction between the types of lock
placed by
<B><A HREF="../man2/flock.2.html">flock</A></B>(2)

and
<B>fcntl</B>().

<P>

Several systems have more fields in
<I>struct flock</I>

such as, for example,
<I>l_sysid</I>.




Clearly,
<I>l_pid</I>

alone is not going to be very useful if the process holding the lock
may live on a different machine.

<H3>Record locking and NFS</H3>

Before Linux 3.12, if an NFSv4 client
loses contact with the server for a period of time
(defined as more than 90 seconds with no communication),





it might lose and regain a lock without ever being aware of the fact.
(The period of time after which contact is assumed lost is known as
the NFSv4 leasetime.
On a Linux NFS server, this can be determined by looking at
<I>/proc/fs/nfsd/nfsv4leasetime</I>,

which expresses the period in seconds.
The default value for this file is 90.)









This scenario potentially risks data corruption,
since another process might acquire a lock in the intervening period
and perform file I/O.
<P>

Since Linux 3.12,

if an NFSv4 client loses contact with the server,
any I/O to the file by a process which &quot;thinks&quot; it holds
a lock will fail until that process closes and reopens the file.
A kernel parameter,
<I>nfs.recover_lost_locks</I>,

can be set to 1 to obtain the pre-3.12 behavior,
whereby the client will attempt to recover lost locks
when contact is reestablished with the server.
Because of the attendant risk of data corruption,

this parameter defaults to 0 (disabled).
<A NAME="lbAY">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>BUGS</H2>

<A NAME="lbAZ">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>F_SETFL</H3>

It is not possible to use
<B>F_SETFL</B>

to change the state of the
<B>O_DSYNC</B>

and
<B>O_SYNC</B>

flags.



Attempts to change the state of these flags are silently ignored.
<A NAME="lbBA">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>F_GETOWN</H3>

A limitation of the Linux system call conventions on some
architectures (notably i386) means that if a (negative)
process group ID to be returned by
<B>F_GETOWN</B>

falls in the range -1 to -4095, then the return value is wrongly
interpreted by glibc as an error in the system call;

that is, the return value of
<B>fcntl</B>()

will be -1, and
<I>errno</I>

will contain the (positive) process group ID.
The Linux-specific
<B>F_GETOWN_EX</B>

operation avoids this problem.




Since glibc version 2.11, glibc makes the kernel
<B>F_GETOWN</B>

problem invisible by implementing
<B>F_GETOWN</B>

using
<B>F_GETOWN_EX</B>.

<A NAME="lbBB">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>F_SETOWN</H3>

In Linux 2.4 and earlier, there is bug that can occur
when an unprivileged process uses
<B>F_SETOWN</B>

to specify the owner
of a socket file descriptor
as a process (group) other than the caller.
In this case,
<B>fcntl</B>()

can return -1 with
<I>errno</I>

set to
<B>EPERM</B>,

even when the owner process (group) is one that the caller
has permission to send signals to.
Despite this error return, the file descriptor owner is set,
and signals will be sent to the owner.

<A NAME="lbBC">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Deadlock detection</H3>

The deadlock-detection algorithm employed by the kernel when dealing with
<B>F_SETLKW</B>

requests can yield both
false negatives (failures to detect deadlocks,
leaving a set of deadlocked processes blocked indefinitely)
and false positives
(<B>EDEADLK</B>

errors when there is no deadlock).
For example,
the kernel limits the lock depth of its dependency search to 10 steps,
meaning that circular deadlock chains that exceed
that size will not be detected.
In addition, the kernel may falsely indicate a deadlock
when two or more processes created using the
<B><A HREF="../man2/clone.2.html">clone</A></B>(2)

<B>CLONE_FILES</B>

flag place locks that appear (to the kernel) to conflict.

<A NAME="lbBD">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Mandatory locking</H3>

The Linux implementation of mandatory locking
is subject to race conditions which render it unreliable:








a
<B><A HREF="../man2/write.2.html">write</A></B>(2)

call that overlaps with a lock may modify data after the mandatory lock is
acquired;
a
<B><A HREF="../man2/read.2.html">read</A></B>(2)

call that overlaps with a lock may detect changes to data that were made
only after a write lock was acquired.
Similar races exist between mandatory locks and
<B><A HREF="../man2/mmap.2.html">mmap</A></B>(2).

It is therefore inadvisable to rely on mandatory locking.
