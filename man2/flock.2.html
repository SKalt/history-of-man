flock - apply or remove an advisory lock on an open file
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>#include &lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/sys/file.h">sys/file.h</A>&gt;</B>

<P>
<B>int flock(int </B><I>fd</I><B>, int </B><I>operation</I><B>);</B>

<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

Apply or remove an advisory lock on the open file specified by
<I>fd</I>.

The argument
<I>operation</I>

is one of the following:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>LOCK_SH</B>

<DD>
Place a shared lock.
More than one process may hold a shared lock for a given file
at a given time.
<DT><B>LOCK_EX</B>

<DD>
Place an exclusive lock.
Only one process may hold an exclusive lock for a given
file at a given time.
<DT><B>LOCK_UN</B>

<DD>
Remove an existing lock held by this process.
</DL>
</DL>

<P>

A call to
<B>flock</B>()

may block if an incompatible lock is held by another process.
To make a nonblocking request, include
<B>LOCK_NB</B>

(by ORing)
with any of the above operations.
<P>
A single file may not simultaneously have both shared and exclusive locks.
<P>
Locks created by
<B>flock</B>()

are associated with an open file description (see
<B><A HREF="../man2/open.2.html">open</A></B>(2)).

This means that duplicate file descriptors (created by, for example,
<B><A HREF="../man2/fork.2.html">fork</A></B>(2)

or
<B><A HREF="../man2/dup.2.html">dup</A></B>(2))

refer to the same lock, and this lock may be modified
or released using any of these file descriptors.
Furthermore, the lock is released either by an explicit
<B>LOCK_UN</B>

operation on any of these duplicate file descriptors, or when all
such file descriptors have been closed.
<P>
If a process uses
<B><A HREF="../man2/open.2.html">open</A></B>(2)

(or similar) to obtain more than one file descriptor for the same file,
these file descriptors are treated independently by
<B>flock</B>().

An attempt to lock the file using one of these file descriptors
may be denied by a lock that the calling process has
already placed via another file descriptor.
<P>
A process may hold only one type of lock (shared or exclusive)
on a file.
Subsequent
<B>flock</B>()

calls on an already locked file will convert an existing lock to the new
lock mode.
<P>
Locks created by
<B>flock</B>()

are preserved across an
<B><A HREF="../man2/execve.2.html">execve</A></B>(2).

<P>
A shared or exclusive lock can be placed on a file regardless of the
mode in which the file was opened.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

On success, zero is returned.
On error, -1 is returned, and
<I>errno</I>

is set appropriately.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EBADF</B>

<DD>
<I>fd</I>

is not an open file descriptor.
<DT><B>EINTR</B>

<DD>
While waiting to acquire a lock, the call was interrupted by
delivery of a signal caught by a handler; see
<B><A HREF="../man7/signal.7.html">signal</A></B>(7).

<DT><B>EINVAL</B>

<DD>
<I>operation</I>

is invalid.
<DT><B>ENOLCK</B>

<DD>
The kernel ran out of memory for allocating lock records.
<DT><B>EWOULDBLOCK</B>

<DD>
The file is locked and the
<B>LOCK_NB</B>

flag was selected.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>CONFORMING TO</H2>

4.4BSD (the
<B>flock</B>()

call first appeared in 4.2BSD).
A version of
<B>flock</B>(),

possibly implemented in terms of
<B><A HREF="../man2/fcntl.2.html">fcntl</A></B>(2),

appears on most UNIX systems.
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NOTES</H2>

Since kernel 2.0,
<B>flock</B>()

is implemented as a system call in its own right rather
than being emulated in the GNU C library as a call to
<B><A HREF="../man2/fcntl.2.html">fcntl</A></B>(2).

With this implementation,
there is no interaction between the types of lock
placed by
<B>flock</B>()

and
<B><A HREF="../man2/fcntl.2.html">fcntl</A></B>(2),

and
<B>flock</B>()

does not detect deadlock.
(Note, however, that on some systems, such as the modern BSDs,

<B>flock</B>()

and
<B><A HREF="../man2/fcntl.2.html">fcntl</A></B>(2)

locks
<I>do</I>

interact with one another.)
<P>

In Linux kernels up to 2.6.11,
<B>flock</B>()

does not lock files over NFS
(i.e., the scope of locks was limited to the local system).
Instead, one could use
<B><A HREF="../man2/fcntl.2.html">fcntl</A></B>(2)

byte-range locking, which does work over NFS,
given a sufficiently recent version of
Linux and a server which supports locking.
Since Linux 2.6.12, NFS clients support
<B>flock</B>()

locks by emulating them as byte-range locks on the entire file.
This means that
<B><A HREF="../man2/fcntl.2.html">fcntl</A></B>(2)

and
<B>flock</B>()

locks
<I>do</I>

interact with one another over NFS.
Since Linux 2.6.37,

the kernel supports a compatibility mode that allows
<B>flock</B>()

locks (and also
<B><A HREF="../man2/fcntl.2.html">fcntl</A></B>(2)

byte region locks) to be treated as local;
see the discussion of the
<I>local_lock</I>

option in
<B><A HREF="../man5/nfs.5.html">nfs</A></B>(5).

<P>

<B>flock</B>()

places advisory locks only; given suitable permissions on a file,
a process is free to ignore the use of
<B>flock</B>()

and perform I/O on the file.
<P>

<B>flock</B>()

and
<B><A HREF="../man2/fcntl.2.html">fcntl</A></B>(2)

locks have different semantics with respect to forked processes and
<B><A HREF="../man2/dup.2.html">dup</A></B>(2).

On systems that implement
<B>flock</B>()

using
<B><A HREF="../man2/fcntl.2.html">fcntl</A></B>(2),

the semantics of
<B>flock</B>()

will be different from those described in this manual page.
<P>

Converting a lock
(shared to exclusive, or vice versa) is not guaranteed to be atomic:
the existing lock is first removed, and then a new lock is established.
Between these two steps,
a pending lock request by another process may be granted,
with the result that the conversion either blocks, or fails if
<B>LOCK_NB</B>

was specified.
(This is the original BSD behavior,
and occurs on many other implementations.)
