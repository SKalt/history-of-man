<H2>NAME</H2>

fork - create a child process
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>#include &lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/unistd.h">unistd.h</A>&gt;</B>

<P>
<B>pid_t fork(void);</B>

<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B>fork</B>()

creates a new process by duplicating the calling process.
The new process is referred to as the
<I>child</I>

process.
The calling process is referred to as the
<I>parent</I>

process.
<P>
The child process and the parent process run in separate memory spaces.
At the time of
<B>fork</B>()

both memory spaces have the same content.
Memory writes, file mappings
(<B><A HREF="../man2/mmap.2.html">mmap</A></B>(2)),

and unmappings
(<B><A HREF="../man2/munmap.2.html">munmap</A></B>(2))

performed by one of the processes do not affect the other.
<P>
The child process is an exact duplicate of the parent
process except for the following points:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
The child has its own unique process ID,
and this PID does not match the ID of any existing process group
(<B><A HREF="../man2/setpgid.2.html">setpgid</A></B>(2)).

<DT>*<DD>
The child's parent process ID is the same as the parent's process ID.
<DT>*<DD>
The child does not inherit its parent's memory locks
(<B><A HREF="../man2/mlock.2.html">mlock</A></B>(2),

<B><A HREF="../man2/mlockall.2.html">mlockall</A></B>(2)).

<DT>*<DD>
Process resource utilizations
(<B><A HREF="../man2/getrusage.2.html">getrusage</A></B>(2))

and CPU time counters
(<B><A HREF="../man2/times.2.html">times</A></B>(2))

are reset to zero in the child.
<DT>*<DD>
The child's set of pending signals is initially empty
(<B><A HREF="../man2/sigpending.2.html">sigpending</A></B>(2)).

<DT>*<DD>
The child does not inherit semaphore adjustments from its parent
(<B><A HREF="../man2/semop.2.html">semop</A></B>(2)).

<DT>*<DD>
The child does not inherit process-associated record locks from its parent
(<B><A HREF="../man2/fcntl.2.html">fcntl</A></B>(2)).

(On the other hand, it does inherit
<B><A HREF="../man2/fcntl.2.html">fcntl</A></B>(2)

open file description locks and
<B><A HREF="../man2/flock.2.html">flock</A></B>(2)

locks from its parent.)
<DT>*<DD>
The child does not inherit timers from its parent
(<B><A HREF="../man2/setitimer.2.html">setitimer</A></B>(2),

<B><A HREF="../man2/alarm.2.html">alarm</A></B>(2),

<B><A HREF="../man2/timer_create.2.html">timer_create</A></B>(2)).

<DT>*<DD>
The child does not inherit outstanding asynchronous I/O operations
from its parent
(<B><A HREF="../man3/aio_read.3.html">aio_read</A></B>(3),

<B><A HREF="../man3/aio_write.3.html">aio_write</A></B>(3)),

nor does it inherit any asynchronous I/O contexts from its parent (see
<B><A HREF="../man2/io_setup.2.html">io_setup</A></B>(2)).

</DL>
<P>

The process attributes in the preceding list are all specified
in POSIX.1-2001.
The parent and child also differ with respect to the following
Linux-specific process attributes:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
The child does not inherit directory change notifications (dnotify)
from its parent
(see the description of
<B>F_NOTIFY</B>

in
<B><A HREF="../man2/fcntl.2.html">fcntl</A></B>(2)).

<DT>*<DD>
The
<B><A HREF="../man2/prctl.2.html">prctl</A></B>(2)

<B>PR_SET_PDEATHSIG</B>

setting is reset so that the child does not receive a signal
when its parent terminates.
<DT>*<DD>
The default timer slack value is set to the parent's
current timer slack value.
See the description of
<B>PR_SET_TIMERSLACK</B>

in
<B><A HREF="../man2/prctl.2.html">prctl</A></B>(2).

<DT>*<DD>
Memory mappings that have been marked with the
<B><A HREF="../man2/madvise.2.html">madvise</A></B>(2)

<B>MADV_DONTFORK</B>

flag are not inherited across a
<B>fork</B>().

<DT>*<DD>
The termination signal of the child is always
<B>SIGCHLD</B>

(see
<B><A HREF="../man2/clone.2.html">clone</A></B>(2)).

<DT>*<DD>
The port access permission bits set by
<B><A HREF="../man2/ioperm.2.html">ioperm</A></B>(2)

are not inherited by the child;
the child must turn on any bits that it requires using
<B><A HREF="../man2/ioperm.2.html">ioperm</A></B>(2).

</DL>
<P>

Note the following further points:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
The child process is created with a single thread---the
one that called
<B>fork</B>().

The entire virtual address space of the parent is replicated in the child,
including the states of mutexes, condition variables,
and other pthreads objects; the use of
<B><A HREF="../man3/pthread_atfork.3.html">pthread_atfork</A></B>(3)

may be helpful for dealing with problems that this can cause.
<DT>*<DD>
The child inherits copies of the parent's set of open file descriptors.
Each file descriptor in the child refers to the same
open file description (see
<B><A HREF="../man2/open.2.html">open</A></B>(2))

as the corresponding file descriptor in the parent.
This means that the two descriptors share open file status flags,
current file offset,
and signal-driven I/O attributes (see the description of
<B>F_SETOWN</B>

and
<B>F_SETSIG</B>

in
<B><A HREF="../man2/fcntl.2.html">fcntl</A></B>(2)).

<DT>*<DD>
The child inherits copies of the parent's set of open message
queue descriptors (see
<B><A HREF="../man7/mq_overview.7.html">mq_overview</A></B>(7)).

Each descriptor in the child refers to the same
open message queue description
as the corresponding descriptor in the parent.
This means that the two descriptors share the same flags
(<I>mq_flags</I>).

<DT>*<DD>
The child inherits copies of the parent's set of open directory streams (see
<B><A HREF="../man3/opendir.3.html">opendir</A></B>(3)).

POSIX.1-2001 says that the corresponding directory streams
in the parent and child
<I>may</I>

share the directory stream positioning;
on Linux/glibc they do not.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

On success, the PID of the child process is returned in the parent,
and 0 is returned in the child.
On failure, -1 is returned in the parent,
no child process is created, and
<I>errno</I>

is set appropriately.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EAGAIN</B>

<DD>
A system-imposed limit on the number of threads was encountered.
There are a number of limits that may trigger this error: the
<B>RLIMIT_NPROC</B>

soft resource limit (set via
<B><A HREF="../man2/setrlimit.2.html">setrlimit</A></B>(2)),

which limits the number of processes and threads for a real user ID,
was reached;
the kernel's system-wide limit on the number of processes and threads,
<I>/proc/sys/kernel/threads-max</I>,

was reached (see
<B><A HREF="../man5/proc.5.html">proc</A></B>(5));

or the maximum number of PIDs,
<I>/proc/sys/kernel/pid_max</I>,

was reached (see
<B><A HREF="../man5/proc.5.html">proc</A></B>(5)).

<DT><B>EAGAIN</B>

<DD>
The caller is operating under the
<B>SCHED_DEADLINE</B>

scheduling policy and does not have the reset-on-fork flag set.
See
<B><A HREF="../man7/sched.7.html">sched</A></B>(7).

<DT><B>ENOMEM</B>

<DD>
<B>fork</B>()

failed to allocate the necessary kernel structures because memory is tight.
<DT><B>ENOSYS</B>

<DD>
<B>fork</B>()

is not supported on this platform (for example,

hardware without a Memory-Management Unit).
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>CONFORMING TO</H2>

SVr4, 4.3BSD, POSIX.1-2001.
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NOTES</H2>

<P>

Under Linux,
<B>fork</B>()

is implemented using copy-on-write pages, so the only penalty that it incurs
is the time and memory required to duplicate the parent's page tables,
and to create a unique task structure for the child.
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>C library/kernel ABI differences</H3>

Since version 2.3.3,

rather than invoking the kernel's
<B>fork</B>()

system call,
the glibc
<B>fork</B>()

wrapper that is provided as part of the
NPTL threading implementation invokes
<B><A HREF="../man2/clone.2.html">clone</A></B>(2)

with flags that provide the same effect as the traditional system call.
(A call to
<B>fork</B>()

is equivalent to a call to
<B><A HREF="../man2/clone.2.html">clone</A></B>(2)

specifying
<I>flags</I>

as just
<B>SIGCHLD</B>.)

The glibc wrapper invokes any fork handlers that have been
established using
<B><A HREF="../man3/pthread_atfork.3.html">pthread_atfork</A></B>(3).
