<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The scheduling priority of the process, process group, or user, as
indicated by
<I>which</I>

and
<I>who</I>

is obtained with the
<B>getpriority</B>()

call and set with the
<B>setpriority</B>()

call.
The process attribute dealt with by these system calls is
the same attribute (also known as the &quot;nice&quot; value) that is dealt with by
<B><A HREF="../man2/nice.2.html">nice</A></B>(2).

<P>
The value
<I>which</I>

is one of
<B>PRIO_PROCESS</B>,

<B>PRIO_PGRP</B>,

or
<B>PRIO_USER</B>,

and
<I>who</I>

is interpreted relative to
<I>which</I>

(a process identifier for
<B>PRIO_PROCESS</B>,

process group
identifier for
<B>PRIO_PGRP</B>,

and a user ID for
<B>PRIO_USER</B>).

A zero value for
<I>who</I>

denotes (respectively) the calling process, the process group of the
calling process, or the real user ID of the calling process.
<P>
The
<I>prio</I>

argument is a value in the range -20 to 19 (but see NOTES below).
with -20 being the highest priority and 19 being the lowest priority.
Attempts to set a priority outside this range
are silently clamped to the range.
The default priority is 0;
lower values give a process a higher scheduling priority.
<P>
The
<B>getpriority</B>()

call returns the highest priority (lowest numerical value)
enjoyed by any of the specified processes.
The
<B>setpriority</B>()

call sets the priorities of all of the specified processes
to the specified value.
<P>
Traditionally, only a privileged process could lower the nice value
(i.e., set a higher priority).
However, since Linux 2.6.12, an unprivileged process can decrease
the nice value of a target process that has a suitable
<B>RLIMIT_NICE</B>

soft limit; see
<B><A HREF="../man2/getrlimit.2.html">getrlimit</A></B>(2)

for details.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

On success,
<B>getpriority</B>()

returns the calling thread's nice value, which may be a negative number.
On error, it returns -1 and sets
<I>errno</I>

to indicate the cause of the error.
Since a successful call to
<B>getpriority</B>()

can legitimately return the value -1, it is necessary
to clear the external variable
<I>errno</I>

prior to the
call, then check it afterward to determine
if -1 is an error or a legitimate value.
<P>
<B>setpriority</B>()

returns 0 on success.
On error, it returns -1 and sets
<I>errno</I>

to indicate the cause of the error.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EINVAL</B>

<DD>
<I>which</I>

was not one of
<B>PRIO_PROCESS</B>,

<B>PRIO_PGRP</B>,

or
<B>PRIO_USER</B>.

<DT><B>ESRCH</B>

<DD>
No process was located using the
<I>which</I>

and
<I>who</I>

values specified.
</DL>
<P>

In addition to the errors indicated above,
<B>setpriority</B>()

may fail if:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EACCES</B>

<DD>
The caller attempted to set a lower nice value
(i.e., a higher process priority), but did not
have the required privilege (on Linux: did not have the
<B>CAP_SYS_NICE</B>

capability).
<DT><B>EPERM</B>

<DD>
A process was located, but its effective user ID did not match
either the effective or the real user ID of the caller,
and was not privileged (on Linux: did not have the
<B>CAP_SYS_NICE</B>

capability).
But see NOTES below.

<H2>CONFORMING TO</H2>

POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008,
SVr4, 4.4BSD (these interfaces first appeared in 4.2BSD).
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NOTES</H2>

For further details on the nice value, see
<B><A HREF="../man7/sched.7.html">sched</A></B>(7).

<P>
<I>Note</I>:

the addition of the &quot;autogroup&quot; feature in Linux 2.6.38 means that
the nice value no longer has its traditional effect in many circumstances.
For details, see
<B><A HREF="../man7/sched.7.html">sched</A></B>(7).

<P>
A child created by
<B><A HREF="../man2/fork.2.html">fork</A></B>(2)

inherits its parent's nice value.
The nice value is preserved across
<B><A HREF="../man2/execve.2.html">execve</A></B>(2).

<P>
The details on the condition for
<B>EPERM</B>

depend on the system.
The above description is what POSIX.1-2001 says, and seems to be followed on
all System&nbsp;V-like systems.
Linux kernels before 2.6.12 required the real or
effective user ID of the caller to match
the real user of the process <I>who</I> (instead of its effective user ID).
Linux 2.6.12 and later require
the effective user ID of the caller to match
the real or effective user ID of the process <I>who</I>.
All BSD-like systems (SunOS 4.1.3, Ultrix 4.2,
4.3BSD, FreeBSD 4.3, OpenBSD-2.5, ...) behave in the same
manner as Linux 2.6.12 and later.
<P>
Including
<I>&lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/sys/time.h">sys/time.h</A>&gt;</I>

is not required these days, but increases portability.
(Indeed,
<I>&lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/sys/resource.h">sys/resource.h</A>&gt;</I>

defines the
<I>rusage</I>

structure with fields of type
<I>struct timeval</I>

defined in
<I>&lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/sys/time.h">sys/time.h</A>&gt;</I>.)


<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>C library/kernel differences</H3>

Within the kernel, nice values are actually represented
using the range 40..1
(since negative numbers are error codes) and these are the values
employed by the
<B>setpriority</B>()

and
<B>getpriority</B>()

system calls.
The glibc wrapper functions for these system calls handle the
translations between the user-land and kernel representations
of the nice value according to the formula
<I>unice&nbsp;=&nbsp;20&nbsp;-&nbsp;knice</I>.

(Thus, the kernel's 40..1 range corresponds to the
range -20..19 as seen by user space.)
<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>BUGS</H2>

According to POSIX, the nice value is a per-process setting.
However, under the current Linux/NPTL implementation of POSIX threads,
the nice value is a per-thread attribute:
different threads in the same process can have different nice values.
Portable applications should avoid relying on the Linux behavior,
which may be made standards conformant in the future.
