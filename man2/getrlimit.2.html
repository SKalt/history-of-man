<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B>getrlimit</B>()

and
<B>setrlimit</B>()

get and set resource limits respectively.
Each resource has an associated soft and hard limit, as defined by the 
<B>rlimit</B>

structure (the
<I>rlim</I>

argument to both
<B>getrlimit</B>()

and 
<B>setrlimit</B>()):

<P>


<PRE>
struct rlimit {
    rlim_t rlim_cur;  /* Soft limit */
    rlim_t rlim_max;  /* Hard limit (ceiling for rlim_cur) */
};

</PRE>


The soft limit is the value that the kernel enforces for the
corresponding resource.
The hard limit acts as a ceiling for the soft limit:
an unprivileged process may only set its soft limit to a value in the 
range from 0 up to the hard limit, and (irreversibly) lower its hard limit.
A privileged process (under Linux: one with the
<B>CAP_SYS_RESOURCE</B>

capability) may make arbitrary changes to either limit value.
<P>

The value
<B>RLIM_INFINITY</B>

denotes no limit on a resource (both in the structure returned by
<B>getrlimit</B>()

and in the structure passed to
<B>setrlimit</B>()).

<P>

<I>resource</I>

must be one of:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>RLIMIT_AS</B>

<DD>
The maximum size of the process's virtual memory (address space) in bytes.

This limit affects calls to
<B><A HREF="../man2/brk.2.html">brk</A></B>(2),

<B><A HREF="../man2/mmap.2.html">mmap</A></B>(2)

and
<B><A HREF="../man2/mremap.2.html">mremap</A></B>(2),

which fail with the error
<B>ENOMEM</B>

upon exceeding this limit. Also automatic stack expansion will fail
(and generate a
<B>SIGSEGV</B>

that kills the process if no alternate stack
has been made available via
<B><A HREF="../man2/sigaltstack.2.html">sigaltstack</A></B>(2)).

Since the value is a <I>long</I>, on machines with a 32-bit <I>long</I>
either this limit is at most 2 GiB, or this resource is unlimited.
<DT><B>RLIMIT_CORE</B>

<DD>
Maximum size of
<I>core</I>

file. When 0 no core dump files are created.
When non-zero, larger dumps are truncated to this size.
<DT><B>RLIMIT_CPU</B>

<DD>
CPU time limit in seconds.
When the process reaches the soft limit, it is sent a
<B>SIGXCPU</B>

signal.
The default action for this signal is to terminate the process.
However, the signal can be caught, and the handler can return control to
the main program.
If the process continues to consume CPU time, it will be sent
<B>SIGXCPU</B>

once per second until the hard limit is reached, at which time
it is sent
<B>SIGKILL</B>.

(This latter point describes Linux 2.2 through 2.6 behaviour.
Implementations vary in how they treat processes which continue to
consume CPU time after reaching the soft limit.
Portable applications that need to catch this signal should
perform an orderly termination upon first receipt of
<B>SIGXCPU</B>.)

<DT><B>RLIMIT_DATA</B>

<DD>
The maximum size of the process's data segment (initialized data,
uninitialized data, and heap).
This limit affects calls to
<B>brk</B>()

and 
<B>sbrk</B>(),

which fail with the error
<B>ENOMEM</B>

upon encountering the soft limit of this resource.
<DT><B>RLIMIT_FSIZE</B>

<DD>
The maximum size of files that the process may create.
Attempts to extend a file beyond this limit result in delivery of a
<B>SIGXFSZ</B>

signal.
By default, this signal terminates a process, but a process can 
catch this signal instead, in which case the relevant system call (e.g., 
<B>write</B>()

<B>truncate</B>())

fails with the error
<B>EFBIG</B>.

<DT><B>RLIMIT_LOCKS</B> (Early Linux 2.4 only)

<DD>

A limit on the combined number of
<B>flock</B>()

locks and 
<B>fcntl</B>()

leases that this process may establish.
<DT><B>RLIMIT_MEMLOCK</B>

<DD>
The maximum number of bytes of memory that may be locked
into RAM.
In effect this limit is rounded down to the nearest multiple
of the system page size.
This limit affects 
<B><A HREF="../man2/mlock.2.html">mlock</A></B>(2)

and 
<B><A HREF="../man2/mlockall.2.html">mlockall</A></B>(2)

and the
<B><A HREF="../man2/mmap.2.html">mmap</A></B>(2)

<B>MAP_LOCKED</B>

operation.
Since Linux 2.6.9 it also affects the
<B><A HREF="../man2/shmctl.2.html">shmctl</A></B>(2)

<B>SHM_LOCK</B>

operation, where it sets a maximum on the total bytes in  
shared memory segments (see
<B><A HREF="../man2/shmget.2.html">shmget</A></B>(2))

that may be locked by the real user ID of the calling process.
The 
<B><A HREF="../man2/shmctl.2.html">shmctl</A></B>(2)

<B>SHM_LOCK</B>

locks are accounted for separately from the per-process memory
locks established by 
<B><A HREF="../man2/mlock.2.html">mlock</A></B>(2),

<B><A HREF="../man2/mlockall.2.html">mlockall</A></B>(2),

and
<B><A HREF="../man2/mmap.2.html">mmap</A></B>(2)

<B>MAP_LOCKED</B>;

a process can lock bytes up to this limit in each of these
two categories.
In Linux kernels before 2.6.9, this limit controlled the amount of
memory that could be locked by a privileged process.
Since Linux 2.6.9, no limits are placed on the amount of memory
that a privileged process may lock, and this limit instead governs
the amount of memory that an unprivileged process may lock.
<DT><B>RLIMIT_MSGQUEUE</B> (Since Linux 2.6.8)

<DD>
Specifies the limit on the number of bytes that can be allocated
for POSIX message queues for the real user ID of the calling process.
This limit is enforced for
<B><A HREF="../man3/mq_open.3.html">mq_open</A></B>(3).


Each message queue that the user creates counts (until it is removed)
against this limit according to the formula:
<PRE>

    bytes = attr.mq_maxmsg * sizeof(struct msg_msg *) +
            attr.mq_maxmsg * attr.mq_msgsize

</PRE>

where 
<I>attr</I>

is the 
<I>mq_attr</I>

structure specified as the fourth argument to
<B>mq_open</B>().

<P>
The first addend in the formula, which includes
<I>sizeof(struct msg_msg *)</I>

(4 bytes on Linux/x86), ensures that the user cannot
create an unlimited number of zero-length messages (such messages
nevertheless each consume some system memory for bookkeeping overhead).
<DT><B>RLIMIT_NICE</B> (since kernel 2.6.12, but see BUGS below)

<DD>
Specifies a ceiling to which the process's nice value can be raised using
<B><A HREF="../man2/setpriority.2.html">setpriority</A></B>(2)

or
<B><A HREF="../man2/nice.2.html">nice</A></B>(2).

The actual ceiling for the nice value is calculated as
<I>20&nbsp;-&nbsp;rlim_cur</I>.

(This strangeness occurs because negative numbers cannot be specified
as resource limit values, since they typically have special meanings.
For example, RLIM_INFINITY typically is the same as -1.)
<DT><B>RLIMIT_NOFILE</B>

<DD>
Specifies a value one greater than the maximum file descriptor number
that can be opened by this process.
Attempts
(<B>open</B>(),

<B>pipe</B>(),

<B>dup</B>(),

etc.)
to exceed this limit yield the error
<B>EMFILE</B>.

<DT><B>RLIMIT_NPROC</B>

<DD>
The maximum number of processes that can be created for the real user
ID of the calling process.
Upon encountering this limit, 
<B>fork</B>()

fails with the error
<B>EAGAIN</B>.

<DT><B>RLIMIT_RSS</B>

<DD>
Specifies the limit (in pages) of the process's resident set
(the number of virtual pages resident in RAM).
This limit only has effect in Linux 2.4.x, x &lt; 30, and there only
affects calls to
<B>madvise</B>()

specifying
<B>MADV_WILLNEED</B>.




<DT><B>RLIMIT_RTPRIO</B> (Since Linux 2.6.12, but see BUGS)

<DD>
Specifies a ceiling on the real-time priority that may be set for 
this process using
<B><A HREF="../man2/sched_setscheduler.2.html">sched_setscheduler</A></B>(2)

and
<B><A HREF="../man2/sched_setparam.2.html">sched_setparam</A></B>(2).

<DT><B>RLIMIT_SIGPENDING</B> (Since Linux 2.6.8)

<DD>
Specifies the limit on the number of signals
that may be queued for the real user ID of the calling process.
Both standard and real-time signals are counted for the purpose of
checking this limit.
However, the limit is only enforced for 
<B><A HREF="../man2/sigqueue.2.html">sigqueue</A></B>(2);

it is always possible to use
<B><A HREF="../man2/kill.2.html">kill</A></B>(2)

to queue one instance of any of the signals that are not already
queued to the process.


<DT><B>RLIMIT_STACK</B>

<DD>
The maximum size of the process stack, in bytes.
Upon reaching this limit, a
<B>SIGSEGV</B>

signal is generated.
To handle this signal, a process must employ an alternate signal stack
(<B><A HREF="../man2/sigaltstack.2.html">sigaltstack</A></B>(2)).

</DL>
<P>

<B>RLIMIT_OFILE</B>

is the BSD name for 
<B>RLIMIT_NOFILE</B>.

<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

On success, zero is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and
<I>errno</I>

is set appropriately.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EFAULT</B>

<DD>
<I>rlim</I>

points outside the accessible address space.
<DT><B>EINVAL</B>

<DD>
<I>resource</I>

is not valid;
or, for
<B>setrlimit</B>():

<I>rlim-&gt;rlim_cur</I>

was greater than
<I>rlim-&gt;rlim_max</I>.

<DT><B>EPERM</B>

<DD>
An unprivileged process tried to use <B>setrlimit</B>() to
increase a soft or hard limit above the current hard limit; the
<B>CAP_SYS_RESOURCE</B>

capability is required to do this.
Or, the process tried to use <B>setrlimit</B>() to increase
the soft or hard RLIMIT_NOFILE limit above the current kernel
maximum (NR_OPEN).
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>BUGS</H2>

In older Linux kernels, the
<B>SIGXCPU</B>

and
<B>SIGKILL</B>

signals delivered when a process encountered the soft and hard
<B>RLIMIT_CPU</B>

limits were delivered one (CPU) second later than they should have been.
This was fixed in kernel 2.6.8.
<P>
A kernel bug means that
<B>RLIMIT_RTPRIO</B>

does not work in kernel 2.6.12; the problem is fixed in kernel 2.6.13.
<P>
In kernel 2.6.12, there was an off-by-one mismatch 
between the priority ranges returned by
<B><A HREF="../man2/getpriority.2.html">getpriority</A></B>(2)

and
<B>RLIMIT_NICE</B>.

This had the effect that actual ceiling for the nice value 
was calculated as
<I>19&nbsp;-&nbsp;rlim_cur</I>.

This was fixed in kernel 2.6.13.

<P>
Kernels before 2.4.22 did not diagnose the error
<B>EINVAL</B>

for 
<B>setrlimit</B>()

when
<I>rlim-&gt;rlim_cur</I>

was greater than
<I>rlim-&gt;rlim_max</I>.
