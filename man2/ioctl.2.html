ioctl - control device
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>#include &lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/sys/ioctl.h">sys/ioctl.h</A>&gt;</B>

<P>
<B>int ioctl(int </B><I>fd</I><B>, unsigned long </B><I>request</I><B>, ...);</B>



<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The
<B>ioctl</B>()

function manipulates the underlying device parameters of special files.
In particular, many operating characteristics of character special files
(e.g., terminals) may be controlled with
<B>ioctl</B>()

requests.
The argument
<I>fd</I>

must be an open file descriptor.
<P>

The second argument is a device-dependent request code.
The third argument is an untyped pointer to memory.
It's traditionally
<B>char *</B><I>argp</I>

(from the days before
<B>void *</B>

was valid C), and will be so named for this discussion.
<P>

An
<B>ioctl</B>()

<I>request</I>

has encoded in it whether the argument is an
<I>in</I>

parameter or
<I>out</I>

parameter, and the size of the argument
<I>argp</I>

in bytes.
Macros and defines used in specifying an
<B>ioctl</B>()

<I>request</I>

are located in the file
<I>&lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/sys/ioctl.h">sys/ioctl.h</A>&gt;</I>.

<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

Usually, on success zero is returned.
A few
<B>ioctl</B>()

requests use the return value as an output parameter
and return a nonnegative value on success.
On error, -1 is returned, and
<I>errno</I>

is set appropriately.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EBADF</B>

<DD>
<I>fd</I>

is not a valid descriptor.
<DT><B>EFAULT</B>

<DD>
<I>argp</I>

references an inaccessible memory area.
<DT><B>EINVAL</B>

<DD>
<I>request</I>

or
<I>argp</I>

is not valid.
<DT><B>ENOTTY</B>

<DD>
<I>fd</I>

is not associated with a character special device.
<DT><B>ENOTTY</B>

<DD>
The specified request does not apply to the kind of object that the
descriptor
<I>fd</I>

references.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>CONFORMING TO</H2>

No single standard.
Arguments, returns, and semantics of
<B>ioctl</B>()

vary according to the device driver in question (the call is used as a
catch-all for operations that don't cleanly fit the UNIX stream I/O
model).
See
<B><A HREF="../man2/ioctl_list.2.html">ioctl_list</A></B>(2)

for a list of many of the known
<B>ioctl</B>()

calls.
The
<B>ioctl</B>()

function call appeared in Version 7 AT&amp;T UNIX.
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NOTES</H2>

In order to use this call, one needs an open file descriptor.
Often the
<B><A HREF="../man2/open.2.html">open</A></B>(2)

call has unwanted side effects, that can be avoided under Linux
by giving it the
<B>O_NONBLOCK</B>

flag.
