iopl - change I/O privilege level
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>#include &lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/sys/io.h">sys/io.h</A>&gt;</B>

<P>

<B>int iopl(int </B><I>level</I><B>);</B>

<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B>iopl</B>()

changes the I/O privilege level of the calling process,
as specified by the two least significant bits in
<I>level</I>.

<P>

This call is necessary to allow 8514-compatible X servers to run under
Linux.
Since these X servers require access to all 65536 I/O ports, the
<B><A HREF="../man2/ioperm.2.html">ioperm</A></B>(2)

call is not sufficient.
<P>

In addition to granting unrestricted I/O port access, running at a higher
I/O privilege level also allows the process to disable interrupts.
This will probably crash the system, and is not recommended.
<P>

Permissions are not inherited by the child process created by
<B><A HREF="../man2/fork.2.html">fork</A></B>(2)

and are not preserved across
<B><A HREF="../man2/execve.2.html">execve</A></B>(2)

(but see NOTES).
<P>

The I/O privilege level for a normal process is 0.
<P>

This call is mostly for the i386 architecture.
On many other architectures it does not exist or will always
return an error.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

On success, zero is returned.
On error, -1 is returned, and
<I>errno</I>

is set appropriately.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EINVAL</B>

<DD>
<I>level</I>

is greater than 3.
<DT><B>ENOSYS</B>

<DD>
This call is unimplemented.
<DT><B>EPERM</B>

<DD>
The calling process has insufficient privilege to call
<B>iopl</B>();

the
<B>CAP_SYS_RAWIO</B>

capability is required to raise the I/O privilege level
above its current value.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>CONFORMING TO</H2>

<B>iopl</B>()

is Linux-specific and should not be used in programs that are
intended to be portable.
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NOTES</H2>




Glibc2 has a prototype both in
<I>&lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/sys/io.h">sys/io.h</A>&gt;</I>

and in
<I>&lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/sys/perm.h">sys/perm.h</A>&gt;</I>.

Avoid the latter, it is available on i386 only.
<P>

Prior to Linux 3.7,
on some architectures (such as i386), permissions
<I>were</I>

inherited by the child produced by
<B><A HREF="../man2/fork.2.html">fork</A></B>(2)

and were preserved across
<B><A HREF="../man2/execve.2.html">execve</A></B>(2).

This behavior was inadvertently changed in Linux 3.7,
and won't be reinstated.
