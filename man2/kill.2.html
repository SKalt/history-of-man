</PRE>

<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The
<B>kill</B>

system call
can be used to send any signal to any process group or process.
<P>

If <I>pid</I> is positive, then signal <I>sig</I> is sent to <I>pid</I>.
<P>

If <I>pid</I> equals 0, then <I>sig</I> is sent to every process in the
process group of the current process.
<P>

If <I>pid</I> equals -1, then <I>sig</I> is sent to every process
for which the calling process has permission to send signals,
except for process 1 (init), but see below.
<P>

If <I>pid</I> is less than -1, then <I>sig</I> is sent to every process
in the process group <I>-pid</I>.
<P>

If <I>sig</I> is 0, then no signal is sent, but error checking is still
performed.
<P>
For a process to have permission to send a signal
it must either be privileged (under Linux: have the
<B>CAP_KILL</B>

capability), or the real or effective
user ID of the sending process must equal the real or
saved set-user-ID of the target process.
In the case of SIGCONT it suffices when the sending and receiving
processes belong to the same session.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

On success (at least one signal was sent), zero is returned.
On error, -1 is returned, and
<I>errno</I>

is set appropriately.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EINVAL</B>

<DD>
An invalid signal was specified.
<DT><B>EPERM</B>

<DD>
The process does not have permission to send the signal
to any of the target processes.
<DT><B>ESRCH</B>

<DD>
The pid or process group does not exist.
Note that an existing process might be a zombie,
a process which already committed termination, but
has not yet been <B>wait()</B>ed for.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NOTES</H2>

The only signals that can be sent task number one, the
<I>init</I>

process, are those for which
<I>init</I>

has explicitly installed signal handlers.
This is done to assure the
system is not brought down accidentally.
<P>

POSIX 1003.1-2001 requires that <I>kill(-1,sig)</I> send <I>sig</I>
to all processes that the current process may send signals to,
except possibly for some implementation-defined system processes.
Linux allows a process to signal itself, but on Linux the call
<I>kill(-1,sig)</I> does not signal the current process.
<P>

POSIX 1003.1-2003 requires that if a process sends a signal to itself,
and that process does not have the signal blocked, and no other thread
has it unblocked or is waiting for it in <I>sigwait()</I>, at least one
unblocked signal must be delivered to the sending thread before the
call of <I>kill()</I> returns.
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>LINUX HISTORY</H2>

Across different kernel versions, Linux has enforced different rules
for the permissions required for an unprivileged process
to send a signal to another process.


In kernels 1.0 to 1.2.2, a signal could be sent if the
effective user ID of the sender matched that of the receiver,
or the real user ID of the sender matched that of the receiver.
From kernel 1.2.3 until 1.3.77, a signal could be sent if the
effective user ID of the sender matched either the real or effective
user ID of the receiver.
The current rules, which conform to POSIX 1003.1-2001, were adopted
in kernel 1.3.78.
