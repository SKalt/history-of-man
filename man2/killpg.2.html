<DL COMPACT>

<DD>
_BSD_SOURCE || _XOPEN_SOURCE&nbsp;&gt;=&nbsp;500 ||
_XOPEN_SOURCE&nbsp;&amp;&amp;&nbsp;_XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED

</DL>
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B>killpg</B>()

sends the signal
<I>sig</I>

to the process group
<I>pgrp</I>.

See
<B><A HREF="../man7/signal.7.html">signal</A></B>(7)

for a list of signals.
<P>
If
<I>pgrp</I>

is 0,
<B>killpg</B>()

sends the signal to the calling process's process group.
(POSIX says: If
<I>pgrp</I>

is less than or equal to 1, the behavior is undefined.)
<P>
For a process to have permission to send a signal
it must either be privileged (under Linux: have the
<B>CAP_KILL</B>

capability), or the real or effective
user ID of the sending process must equal the real or
saved set-user-ID of the target process.
In the case of
<B>SIGCONT</B>

it suffices when the sending and receiving
processes belong to the same session.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

On success, zero is returned.
On error, -1 is returned, and
<I>errno</I>

is set appropriately.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EINVAL</B>

<DD>
<I>sig</I>

is not a valid signal number.
<DT><B>EPERM</B>

<DD>
The process does not have permission to send the signal
to any of the target processes.
<DT><B>ESRCH</B>

<DD>
No process can be found in the process group specified by
<I>pgrp</I>.

<DT><B>ESRCH</B>

<DD>
The process group was given as 0 but the sending process does not
have a process group.

<H2>CONFORMING TO</H2>

SVr4, 4.4BSD (the
<B>killpg</B>()

function call first appeared in 4BSD), POSIX.1-2001.
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NOTES</H2>

There are various differences between the permission checking
in BSD-type systems and System&nbsp;V-type systems.
See the POSIX rationale for
<B>kill</B>().

A difference not mentioned by POSIX concerns the return
value
<B>EPERM</B>:

BSD documents that no signal is sent and
<B>EPERM</B>

returned when the permission check failed for at least one target process,
while POSIX documents
<B>EPERM</B>

only when the permission check failed for all target processes.
<P>
On Linux,
<B>killpg</B>()

is implemented as a library function that makes the call
<I>kill(-pgrp,&nbsp;sig)</I>.
