<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B>mount</B>()

attaches the file system specified by
<I>source</I>

(which is often a device name, but can also be a directory name
or a dummy) to the directory specified by
<I>target</I>.

<P>
Appropriate privilege (Linux: the
<B>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</B>

capability) is required to mount file systems.
<P>
Since Linux 2.4 a single file system can be visible at
multiple mount points, and multiple mounts can be stacked
on the same mount point.

<P>
Values for the
<I>filesystemtype</I>

argument supported by the kernel are listed in
<I>/proc/filesystems</I>

(like &quot;minix&quot;, &quot;ext2&quot;, &quot;ext3&quot;, &quot;jfs&quot;, &quot;xfs&quot;, &quot;reiserfs&quot;,
&quot;msdos&quot;, &quot;proc&quot;, &quot;nfs&quot;, &quot;iso9660&quot; etc.).
Further types may become available when the appropriate modules
are loaded.
<P>
The
<I>mountflags</I>

argument may have the magic number 0xC0ED (<B>MS_MGC_VAL</B>)
in the top 16 bits (this was required in kernel versions prior to 2.4, but
is no longer required and ignored if specified),
and various mount flags (as defined in <I>&lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/linux/fs.h">linux/fs.h</A>&gt;</I> for libc4 and libc5
and in <I>&lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/sys/mount.h">sys/mount.h</A>&gt;</I> for glibc2) in the low order 16 bits:

















<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>MS_BIND</B> (Linux 2.4 onwards)

<DD>

Perform a bind mount, making a file or a directory subtree visible at
another point within a file system.
Bind mounts may cross file system boundaries and span
<B><A HREF="../man2/chroot.2.html">chroot</A></B>(2)

jails.
The
<I>filesystemtype</I>

and
<I>data</I>

arguments are ignored.
Up until Linux 2.6.26,
<I>mountflags</I>

was also ignored

(the bind mount has the same mount options as
the underlying mount point).
Since Linux 2.6.26, the
<B>MS_RDONLY</B>

flag is honored when making a bind mount.
<DT><B>MS_DIRSYNC</B> (since Linux 2.5.19)

<DD>
Make directory changes on this file system synchronous.
(This property can be obtained for individual directories
or subtrees using
<B><A HREF="../man1/chattr.1.html">chattr</A></B>(1).)

<DT><B>MS_MANDLOCK</B>

<DD>
Permit mandatory locking on files in this file system.
(Mandatory locking must still be enabled on a per-file basis,
as described in
<B><A HREF="../man2/fcntl.2.html">fcntl</A></B>(2).)


<DT><B>MS_MOVE</B>

<DD>
Move a subtree.
<I>source</I>

specifies an existing mount point and
<I>target</I>

specifies the new location.
The move is atomic: at no point is the subtree unmounted.
The
<I>filesystemtype</I>, <I>mountflags</I>, and <I>data</I>

arguments are ignored.
<DT><B>MS_NOATIME</B>

<DD>
Do not update access times for (all types of) files on this file system.
<DT><B>MS_NODEV</B>

<DD>
Do not allow access to devices (special files) on this file system.
<DT><B>MS_NODIRATIME</B>

<DD>
Do not update access times for directories on this file system.
This flag provides a subset of the functionality provided by
<B>MS_NOATIME</B>;

that is,
<B>MS_NOATIME</B>

implies
<B>MS_NODIRATIME</B>.

<DT><B>MS_NOEXEC</B>

<DD>
Do not allow programs to be executed from this file system.



<DT><B>MS_NOSUID</B>

<DD>
Do not honor set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits when executing
programs from this file system.


<DT><B>MS_RDONLY</B>

<DD>
Mount file system read-only.




<DT><B>MS_RELATIME</B> (Since Linux 2.6.20)

<DD>
When a file on this file system is accessed,
only update the file's last access time (atime) if the current value
of atime is less than or equal to the file's last modification time (mtime)
or last status change time (ctime).
This option is useful for programs, such as
<B><A HREF="../man1/mutt.1.html">mutt</A></B>(1),

that need to know when a file has been read since it was last modified.
<DT><B>MS_REMOUNT</B>

<DD>
Remount an existing mount.
This allows you to change the
<I>mountflags</I>

and
<I>data</I>

of an existing mount without having to unmount and remount the file system.
<I>source</I>

and
<I>target</I>

should be the same values specified in the initial
<B>mount</B>()

call;
<I>filesystemtype</I>

is ignored.
<P>
The following
<I>mountflags</I>

can be changed:
<B>MS_RDONLY</B>,

<B>MS_SYNCHRONOUS</B>,

<B>MS_MANDLOCK</B>;

before kernel 2.6.16, the following could also be changed:
<B>MS_NOATIME</B>

and
<B>MS_NODIRATIME</B>;

and, additionally, before kernel 2.4.10, the following could also be changed:
<B>MS_NOSUID</B>,

<B>MS_NODEV</B>,

<B>MS_NOEXEC</B>.

<DT><B>MS_SILENT</B> (since Linux 2.6.17)

<DD>
Suppress the display of certain
(<I>printk</I>())

warning messages in the kernel log.
This flag supersedes the misnamed and obsolete
<B>MS_VERBOSE</B>

flag (available since Linux 2.4.12), which has the same meaning.
<DT><B>MS_SYNCHRONOUS</B>

<DD>
Make writes on this file system synchronous (as though
the
<B>O_SYNC</B>

flag to
<B><A HREF="../man2/open.2.html">open</A></B>(2)

was specified for all file opens to this file system).
</DL>
<P>

From Linux 2.4 onwards, the
<B>MS_NODEV</B>, <B>MS_NOEXEC</B>, and <B>MS_NOSUID</B>

flags are settable on a per-mount-point basis.
From kernel 2.6.16 onwards,
<B>MS_NOATIME</B>

and
<B>MS_NODIRATIME</B>

are also settable on a per-mount-point basis.
The
<B>MS_RELATIME</B>

flag is also settable on a per-mount-point basis.
<P>

The
<I>data</I>

argument is interpreted by the different file systems.
Typically it is a string of comma-separated options
understood by this file system.
See
<B><A HREF="../man8/mount.8.html">mount</A></B>(8)

for details of the options available for each filesystem type.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

On success, zero is returned.
On error, -1 is returned, and
<I>errno</I>

is set appropriately.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

The error values given below result from filesystem type independent
errors.
Each filesystem type may have its own special errors and its
own special behavior.
See the kernel source code for details.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EACCES</B>

<DD>
A component of a path was not searchable.
(See also
<B><A HREF="../man7/path_resolution.7.html">path_resolution</A></B>(7).)

Or, mounting a read-only filesystem was attempted without giving the
<B>MS_RDONLY</B>

flag.
Or, the block device
<I>source</I>

is located on a filesystem mounted with the
<B>MS_NODEV</B>

option.


<DT><B>EBUSY</B>

<DD>
<I>source</I>

is already mounted.
Or, it cannot be remounted read-only,
because it still holds files open for writing.
Or, it cannot be mounted on
<I>target</I>

because
<I>target</I>

is still busy (it is the working directory of some task,
the mount point of another device, has open files, etc.).
<DT><B>EFAULT</B>

<DD>
One of the pointer arguments points outside the user address space.
<DT><B>EINVAL</B>

<DD>
<I>source</I>

had an invalid superblock.
Or, a remount
(<B>MS_REMOUNT</B>)

was attempted, but
<I>source</I>

was not already mounted on
<I>target</I>.

Or, a move
(<B>MS_MOVE</B>)

was attempted, but
<I>source</I>

was not a mount point, or was '/'.
<DT><B>ELOOP</B>

<DD>
Too many links encountered during pathname resolution.
Or, a move was attempted, while
<I>target</I>

is a descendant of
<I>source</I>.

<DT><B>EMFILE</B>

<DD>
(In case no block device is required:)
Table of dummy devices is full.
<DT><B>ENAMETOOLONG</B>

<DD>
A pathname was longer than
<B>MAXPATHLEN</B>.

<DT><B>ENODEV</B>

<DD>
<I>filesystemtype</I>

not configured in the kernel.
<DT><B>ENOENT</B>

<DD>
A pathname was empty or had a nonexistent component.
<DT><B>ENOMEM</B>

<DD>
The kernel could not allocate a free page to copy filenames or data into.
<DT><B>ENOTBLK</B>

<DD>
<I>source</I>

is not a block device (and a device was required).
<DT><B>ENOTDIR</B>

<DD>
<I>target</I>,

or a prefix of
<I>source</I>,

is not a directory.
<DT><B>ENXIO</B>

<DD>
The major number of the block device
<I>source</I>

is out of range.
<DT><B>EPERM</B>

<DD>
The caller does not have the required privileges.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>CONFORMING TO</H2>

This function is Linux-specific and should not be used in
programs intended to be portable.
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NOTES</H2>

The original
<B>MS_SYNC</B>

flag was renamed
<B>MS_SYNCHRONOUS</B>

in 1.1.69
when a different
<B>MS_SYNC</B>

was added to <I>&lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/mman.h">mman.h</A>&gt;</I>.
<P>

Before Linux 2.4 an attempt to execute a set-user-ID or set-group-ID program
on a filesystem mounted with
<B>MS_NOSUID</B>

would fail with
<B>EPERM</B>.

Since Linux 2.4 the set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits are
just silently ignored in this case.

<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Per-process Namespaces</H3>

Starting with kernel 2.4.19, Linux provides per-process namespaces.
A namespace is the set of file system mounts that are visible to a process.
Namespaces can be (and usually are) shared between multiple processes,
and changes to the namespace (i.e., mounts and unmounts) by one process
are visible to all other processes sharing the same namespace.
(The pre-2.4.19 Linux situation can be considered as one in which there
was a single namespace was shared by every process on the system.)
<P>
A child process created by
<B><A HREF="../man2/fork.2.html">fork</A></B>(2)

shares its parent's namespace;
the namespace is preserved across an
<B><A HREF="../man2/execve.2.html">execve</A></B>(2).

<P>
A process can obtain a private namespace if:
it was created using the
<B>clone</B>()

<B>CLONE_NEWNS</B>

flag,
in which case its new namespace is initialized to be a
<I>copy</I>

of the namespace of the process that called
<B>clone</B>();

or it calls
<B><A HREF="../man2/unshare.2.html">unshare</A></B>(2)

with the
<B>CLONE_NEWNS</B>

flag,
which causes the caller's namespace to obtain a private copy
of the namespace that it was previously sharing with other processes,
so that future mounts and unmounts by the caller are invisible
to other processes (except child processes that the caller
subsequently creates) and vice versa.
<P>
The Linux-specific
<I>/proc/PID/self</I>

file exposes the list of mount points in the namespace of the process with
the specified ID; see
<B><A HREF="../man5/proc.5.html">proc</A></B>(5)

for details.
