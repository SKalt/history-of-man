mremap - re-map a virtual memory address

<B>, size_t </B><I>new_size</I><B>, int </B><I>flags</I><B>);</B>


<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B>mremap</B>() expands (or shrinks) an existing memory mapping, potentially 
moving it at the same time (controlled by the <I>flags</I> argument and 
the available virtual address space).
<P>
<I>old_address</I> is the old address of the virtual memory block that you
want to expand (or shrink).  Note that <I>old_address</I> has to be page 
aligned. <I>old_size</I> is the old size of the 
virtual memory block.  <I>new_size</I> is the requested size of the
virtual memory block after the resize. 
<P>
In Linux the memory is divided into pages.  A user process has (one or)
several linear virtual memory segments.  Each virtual memory segment has one
or more mappings to real memory pages (in the page table).  Each virtual
memory segment has its own protection (access rights), which may cause
a segmentation violation if the memory is accessed incorrectly (e.g.,
writing to a read-only segment).  Accessing virtual memory outside of the
segments will also cause a segmentation violation.
<P>
<B>mremap</B>() uses the Linux page table scheme.
<B>mremap</B>() changes the 
mapping between virtual addresses and memory pages.  This can be used to
implement a very efficient <B>realloc</B>().
<P>
The <I>flags</I> bit-mask argument may be 0, or include the following flag:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>MREMAP_MAYMOVE</B>

<DD>
By default, if there is not sufficient space to expand a mapping
at its current location, then
<B>mremap</B>()

fails.
If this flag is specified, then the kernel is permitted to 
relocate the mapping to a new virtual address, if necessary.
If the mapping is relocated,
then absolute pointers into the old mapping location 
become invalid (offsets relative to the starting address of 
the mapping should be employed).
<DT><B>MREMAP_FIXED</B> (since Linux 2.3.31)

<DD>
This flag serves a similar purpose to the
<B>MAP_FIXED</B>

flag of
<B><A HREF="../man2/mmap.2.html">mmap</A></B>(2).

If this flag is specified, then
<B>mremap</B>()

accepts a fifth argument,
<I>void *new_address</I>,

which specifies a page-aligned address to which the mapping must
be moved.
Any previous mapping at the address range specified by
<I>new_address</I>

and
<I>new_size</I>

is unmapped.
If 
<B>MREMAP_FIXED</B>

is specified, then 
<B>MREMAP_MAYMOVE</B>

must also be specified.
</DL>
<P>

If the memory segment specified by 
<I>old_address</I>

and 
<I>old_size</I>

is locked (using
<B>mlock</B>()

or similar), then this lock is maintained when the segment is
resized and/or relocated.
As a consequence, the amount of memory locked by the process may change.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

On success <B>mremap</B>() returns a pointer to the new virtual memory area.
On error, the value
<B>MAP_FAILED</B>

(that is, (void *) -1) is returned, and <I>errno</I> is set appropriately.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EAGAIN</B>

<DD>
The caller tried to expand a memory segment that is locked, 
but this was not possible without exceeding the
RLIMIT_MEMLOCK resource limit.
<DT><B>EFAULT</B>

<DD>
&quot;Segmentation fault.&quot; Some address in the range
<I>old_address</I> to <I>old_address</I>+<I>old_size</I> is an invalid
virtual memory address for this process.
You can also get EFAULT even if there exist mappings that cover the
whole address space requested, but those mappings are of different types.
<DT><B>EINVAL</B>

<DD>
An invalid argument was given.
Possible causes are: <I>old_address</I> was not 
page aligned; a value other than
<B>MREMAP_MAYMOVE</B>

or 
<B>MREMAP_FIXED</B>

was specified in
<I>flags</I>;

<I>new_size</I>

was zero;
<I>new_size</I>

or 
<I>new_address</I>

was invalid;
or the new address range specified by
<I>new_address </I>

and 
<I>new_size</I>

overlapped the old address range specified by
<I>old_address</I>

and
<I>old_size</I>;

or 
<B>MREMAP_FIXED</B>

was specified without also specifying
<B>MREMAP_MAYMOVE</B>.

<DT><B>ENOMEM</B>

<DD>
The memory area cannot be expanded at the current virtual address, and the
<B>MREMAP_MAYMOVE</B>

flag is not set in <I>flags</I>. 
Or, there is not enough (virtual) memory available.
</DL>

<H2>NOTES</H2>

Prior to version 2.4, glibc did not expose the definition of
<B>MREMAP_FIXED</B>,

and the prototype for
<B>mremap</B>()

did not allow for the
<I>new_address</I>

argument.
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>CONFORMING TO</H2>

This call is Linux-specific, and should not be used in programs
intended to be portable.  4.2BSD had a (never actually implemented)
<B><A HREF="../man2/mremap.2.html">mremap</A></B>(2)

call with completely different semantics.
