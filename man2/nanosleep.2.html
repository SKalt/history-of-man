<B>nanosleep</B>():

_POSIX_C_SOURCE&nbsp;&gt;=&nbsp;199309L
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B>nanosleep</B>()

suspends the execution of the calling thread
until either at least the time specified in
<I>*req</I>

has elapsed, or the delivery of a signal
that triggers the invocation of a handler in the calling thread or
that terminates the process.
<P>
If the call is interrupted by a signal handler,
<B>nanosleep</B>()

returns -1, sets <I>errno</I> to
<B>EINTR</B>,

and writes the remaining time into the structure pointed to by
<I>rem</I>

unless
<I>rem</I>

is NULL.
The value of
<I>*rem</I>

can then be used to call
<B>nanosleep</B>()

again and complete the specified pause (but see NOTES).
<P>
The structure
<I>timespec</I>

is used to specify intervals of time with nanosecond precision.
It is defined as follows:
<P>

<PRE>
struct timespec {
    time_t tv_sec;        /* seconds */
    long   tv_nsec;       /* nanoseconds */
};
</PRE>


<P>

The value of the nanoseconds field must be in the range 0 to 999999999.
<P>
Compared to
<B><A HREF="../man3/sleep.3.html">sleep</A></B>(3)

and
<B><A HREF="../man3/usleep.3.html">usleep</A></B>(3),

<B>nanosleep</B>()

has the following advantages:
it provides a higher resolution for specifying the sleep interval;
POSIX.1 explicitly specifies that it
does not interact with signals;
and it makes the task of resuming a sleep that has been
interrupted by a signal handler easier.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

On successfully sleeping for the requested interval,
<B>nanosleep</B>()

returns 0.
If the call is interrupted by a signal handler or encounters an error,
then it returns -1, with
<I>errno</I>

set to indicate the error.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EFAULT</B>

<DD>
Problem with copying information from user space.
<DT><B>EINTR</B>

<DD>
The pause has been interrupted by a signal that was
delivered to the thread.
The remaining sleep time has been written
into <I>*rem</I> so that the thread can easily call
<B>nanosleep</B>()

again and continue with the pause.
<DT><B>EINVAL</B>

<DD>
The value in the
<I>tv_nsec</I>

field was not in the range 0 to 999999999 or
<I>tv_sec</I>

was negative.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>CONFORMING TO</H2>

POSIX.1-2001.
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NOTES</H2>

If the interval specified in
<I>req</I>

is not an exact multiple of the granularity underlying clock (see
<B><A HREF="../man7/time.7.html">time</A></B>(7)),

then the interval will be rounded up to the next multiple.
Furthermore, after the sleep completes, there may still be a delay before
the CPU becomes free to once again execute the calling thread.
<P>
The fact that
<B>nanosleep</B>()

sleeps for a relative interval can be problematic if the call
is repeatedly restarted after being interrupted by signals,
since the time between the interruptions and restarts of the call
will lead to drift in the time when the sleep finally completes.
This problem can be avoided by using
<B><A HREF="../man2/clock_nanosleep.2.html">clock_nanosleep</A></B>(2)

with an absolute time value.
<P>
POSIX.1 specifies that
<B>nanosleep</B>()

should measure time against the
<B>CLOCK_REALTIME</B>

clock.
However, Linux measures the time using the
<B>CLOCK_MONOTONIC</B>

clock.



This probably does not matter, since the POSIX.1 specification for
<B><A HREF="../man2/clock_settime.2.html">clock_settime</A></B>(2)

says that discontinuous changes in
<B>CLOCK_REALTIME</B>

should not affect
<B>nanosleep</B>():

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

Setting the value of the
<B>CLOCK_REALTIME</B>

clock via
<B><A HREF="../man2/clock_settime.2.html">clock_settime</A></B>(2)

shall
have no effect on threads that are blocked waiting for a relative time
service based upon this clock, including the
<B>nanosleep</B>()

function; ...
Consequently, these time services shall expire when the requested relative
interval elapses, independently of the new or old value of the clock.
</DL>

<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Old behavior</H3>

In order to support applications requiring much more precise pauses
(e.g., in order to control some time-critical hardware),
<B>nanosleep</B>()

would handle pauses of up to 2&nbsp;ms by busy waiting with microsecond
precision when called from a thread scheduled under a real-time policy
like
<B>SCHED_FIFO</B>

or
<B>SCHED_RR</B>.

This special extension was removed in kernel 2.5.39,
hence is still present in
current 2.4 kernels, but not in 2.6 kernels.
<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>BUGS</H2>

In Linux 2.4, if
<B>nanosleep</B>()

is stopped by a signal (e.g.,
<B>SIGTSTP</B>),

then the call fails with the error
<B>EINTR</B>

after the thread is resumed by a
<B>SIGCONT</B>

signal.
If the system call is subsequently restarted,
then the time that the thread spent in the stopped state is
<I>not</I> counted against the sleep interval.
