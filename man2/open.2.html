<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

Given a
<I>pathname</I>

for a file,
<B>open</B>()

returns a file descriptor, a small, non-negative integer 
for use in subsequent system calls
(<B><A HREF="../man2/read.2.html">read</A></B>(2), <B><A HREF="../man2/write.2.html">write</A></B>(2), <B><A HREF="../man2/lseek.2.html">lseek</A></B>(2), <B><A HREF="../man2/fcntl.2.html">fcntl</A></B>(2), etc.).

The file descriptor returned by a successful call will be
the lowest-numbered file descriptor not currently open for the process.
<P>

The new file descriptor is set to remain open across an 
<B><A HREF="../man2/execve.2.html">execve</A></B>(2)

(i.e., the
<B>FD_CLOEXEC</B>

file descriptor flag described in
<B><A HREF="../man2/fcntl.2.html">fcntl</A></B>(2)

is initially disabled).
The file offset is set to the beginning of the file (see
<B><A HREF="../man2/lseek.2.html">lseek</A></B>(2)).

<P>

A call to
<B>open</B>()

creates a new
<I>open file description</I>,

an entry in the system-wide table of open files.
This entry records the file offset and the file status flags
(modifiable via the
<B>fcntl</B>()

<B>F_SETFL</B>

operation).
A file descriptor is a reference to one of these entries;
this reference is unaffected if
<I>pathname</I>

is subsequently removed or modified to refer to a different file.
The new open file description is initially not shared
with any other process,
but sharing may arise via
<B><A HREF="../man2/fork.2.html">fork</A></B>(2).

<P>

The parameter
<I>flags</I>

must include one of the following
<I>access modes</I>:

<B>O_RDONLY</B>, <B>O_WRONLY</B>, or <B>O_RDWR.</B>

These request opening the file read-only, write-only, or read/write,
respectively.
In addition, zero or more of the following may be
bitwise-<I>or</I>'d

in
<I>flags</I>:

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>O_APPEND</B>

<DD>
The file is opened in append mode. Before each
<B>write</B>(),

the file offset is positioned at the end of the file,
as if with
<B>lseek</B>().

<B>O_APPEND</B>

may lead to corrupted files on NFS file systems if more than one process
appends data to a file at once.  This is because NFS does not support
appending to a file, so the client kernel has to simulate it, which
can't be done without a race condition.
<DT><B>O_ASYNC</B>

<DD>


Generate a signal (SIGIO by default, but this can be changed via
<B><A HREF="../man2/fcntl.2.html">fcntl</A></B>(2))

when input or output becomes possible on this file descriptor.
This feature is only available for terminals, pseudo-terminals, 
sockets, and (since Linux 2.6) pipes and FIFOs.
See
<B><A HREF="../man2/fcntl.2.html">fcntl</A></B>(2)

for further details.
<DT><B>O_CREAT</B>

<DD>
If the file does not exist it will be created.
The owner (user ID) of the file is set to the effective user ID
of the process. The group ownership (group ID) is set either to
the effective group ID of the process or to the group ID of the
parent directory (depending on filesystem type and mount options,
and the mode of the parent directory, see, e.g., the mount options
<I>bsdgroups</I>

and
<I>sysvgroups</I>

of the ext2 filesystem, as described in
<B><A HREF="../man8/mount.8.html">mount</A></B>(8)).

<DT><B>O_DIRECT</B>

<DD>
Try to minimize cache effects of the I/O to and from this file.
In general this will degrade performance, but it is useful in
special situations, such as when applications do their own caching.
File I/O is done directly to/from user space buffers.
The I/O is synchronous, i.e., at the completion of a
<B><A HREF="../man2/read.2.html">read</A></B>(2)

or
<B><A HREF="../man2/write.2.html">write</A></B>(2),

data is guaranteed to have been transferred.
Under Linux 2.4 transfer sizes, and the alignment of user buffer
and file offset must all be multiples of the logical block size
of the file system. Under Linux 2.6 alignment to 512-byte boundaries
suffices.


<BR>

A semantically similar interface for block devices is described in
<B><A HREF="../man8/raw.8.html">raw</A></B>(8).

<DT><B>O_DIRECTORY</B>

<DD>
If <I>pathname</I> is not a directory, cause the open to fail.  




This flag is Linux-specific, and was added in kernel version 2.1.126, to
avoid denial-of-service problems if <B><A HREF="../man3/opendir.3.html">opendir</A></B>(3) is called on a
FIFO or tape device, but should not be used outside of the
implementation of <B>opendir</B>.
<DT><B>O_EXCL</B>

<DD>
When used with
<B>O_CREAT</B>,

if the file already exists it is an error and the
<B>open</B>()

will fail. In this context, a symbolic link exists, regardless
of where it points to.
<B>O_EXCL</B>

is broken on NFS file systems; programs which rely on it for performing
locking tasks will contain a race condition.  The solution for performing
atomic file locking using a lockfile is to create a unique file on
the same file system (e.g., incorporating hostname and pid), use
<B><A HREF="../man2/link.2.html">link</A></B>(2)

to make a link to the lockfile. If <B>link</B>() returns 0, the lock is
successful.  Otherwise, use
<B><A HREF="../man2/stat.2.html">stat</A></B>(2)

on the unique file to check if its link count has increased to 2,
in which case the lock is also successful.
<DT><B>O_LARGEFILE</B>

<DD>
(LFS)
Allow files whose sizes cannot be represented in an
<I>off_t</I>

(but can be represented in an
<I>off64_t</I>)

to be opened.
<DT><B>O_NOATIME</B>

<DD>
(Since Linux 2.6.8)
Do not update the file last access time (st_atime in the inode)
when the file is
<B><A HREF="../man2/read.2.html">read</A></B>(2).

This flag is intended for use by indexing or backup programs,
where its use can significantly reduce the amount of disk activity.
This flag may not be effective on all filesystems.
One example is NFS, where the server maintains the access time.


<DT><B>O_NOCTTY</B>

<DD>
If
<I>pathname</I>

refers to a terminal device --- see
<B><A HREF="../man4/tty.4.html">tty</A></B>(4)

--- it will not become the process's controlling terminal even if the
process does not have one.
<DT><B>O_NOFOLLOW</B>

<DD>
If <I>pathname</I> is a symbolic link, then the open fails.  This is a
FreeBSD extension, which was added to Linux in version 2.1.126.
Symbolic links in earlier components of the pathname will still be
followed.



<DT><B>O_NONBLOCK</B> or <B>O_NDELAY</B>

<DD>
When possible, the file is opened in non-blocking mode. Neither the
<B>open</B>()

nor any subsequent operations on the file descriptor which is
returned will cause the calling process to wait.
For the handling of FIFOs (named pipes), see also
<B><A HREF="../man4/fifo.4.html">fifo</A></B>(4).

This mode need not have any effect on files other than FIFOs.
<DT><B>O_SYNC</B>

<DD>
The file is opened for synchronous I/O. Any
<B>write</B>()s

on the resulting file descriptor will block the calling process until
the data has been physically written to the underlying hardware.
<I>See RESTRICTIONS below, though.</I>

<DT><B>O_TRUNC</B>

<DD>
If the file already exists and is a regular file and the open mode allows
writing (i.e., is O_RDWR or O_WRONLY) it will be truncated to length 0.
If the file is a FIFO or terminal device file, the O_TRUNC
flag is ignored. Otherwise the effect of O_TRUNC is unspecified.
</DL>
<P>

Some of these optional flags can be altered using
<B>fcntl</B>()

after the file has been opened.
<P>
The argument
<I>mode</I>

specifies the permissions to use in case a new file is created. It is
modified by the process's
<B>umask</B>

in the usual way: the permissions of the created file are
<B>(mode &amp; ~umask)</B>.

Note that this mode only applies to future accesses of the
newly created file; the
<B>open</B>()

call that creates a read-only file may well return a read/write
file descriptor.
<P>

The following symbolic constants are provided for
<I>mode</I>:

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>S_IRWXU</B>

<DD>
00700 user (file owner) has read, write and execute permission
<DT><B>S_IRUSR (S_IREAD)</B>

<DD>
00400 user has read permission
<DT><B>S_IWUSR (S_IWRITE)</B>

<DD>
00200 user has write permission
<DT><B>S_IXUSR (S_IEXEC)</B>

<DD>
00100 user has execute permission
<DT><B>S_IRWXG</B>

<DD>
00070 group has read, write and execute permission
<DT><B>S_IRGRP</B>

<DD>
00040 group has read permission
<DT><B>S_IWGRP</B>

<DD>
00020 group has write permission
<DT><B>S_IXGRP</B>

<DD>
00010 group has execute permission
<DT><B>S_IRWXO</B>

<DD>
00007 others have read, write and execute permission
<DT><B>S_IROTH</B>

<DD>
00004 others have read permission
<DT><B>S_IWOTH</B>

<DD>
00002 others have write permission
<DT><B>S_IXOTH</B>

<DD>
00001 others have execute permission
</DL>
<P>

<I>mode</I>

must be specified when
<B>O_CREAT</B>

is in the
<I>flags</I>,

and is ignored otherwise.
<P>
<B>creat</B>()

is equivalent to
<B>open</B>()

with
<I>flags</I>

equal to
<B>O_CREAT|O_WRONLY|O_TRUNC</B>.

<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

<B>open</B>()

and 
<B>creat</B>()

return the new file descriptor, or -1 if an error occurred
(in which case,
<I>errno</I>

is set appropriately).
Note that
<B>open</B>()

can open device special files, but
<B>creat</B>()

cannot create them; use
<B><A HREF="../man2/mknod.2.html">mknod</A></B>(2)

instead.
<P>

On NFS file systems with UID mapping enabled, <B>open</B>() may 
return a file descriptor but e.g. <B><A HREF="../man2/read.2.html">read</A></B>(2) requests are denied
with <B>EACCES</B>.
This is because the client performs <B>open</B>() by checking the
permissions, but UID mapping is performed by the server upon
read and write requests.
<P>
If the file is newly created, its st_atime, st_ctime, st_mtime fields
(respectively, time of last access, time of last status change, and
time of last modification; see
<B><A HREF="../man2/stat.2.html">stat</A></B>(2))

are set
to the current time, and so are the st_ctime and st_mtime fields of the
parent directory.
Otherwise, if the file is modified because of the O_TRUNC flag,
its st_ctime and st_mtime fields are set to the current time.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EACCES</B>

<DD>
The requested access to the file is not allowed, or search permission
is denied for one of the directories in the path prefix of
<I>pathname</I>,

or the file did not exist yet and write access to the parent directory
is not allowed.
(See also
<B><A HREF="../man2/path_resolution.2.html">path_resolution</A></B>(2).)

<DT><B>EEXIST</B>

<DD>
<I>pathname</I>

already exists and
<B>O_CREAT</B> and <B>O_EXCL</B>

were used.
<DT><B>EFAULT</B>

<DD>
<I>pathname</I>

points outside your accessible address space.
<DT><B>EISDIR</B>

<DD>
<I>pathname</I>

refers to a directory and the access requested involved writing
(that is,
<B>O_WRONLY</B>

or
<B>O_RDWR</B>

is set).
<DT><B>ELOOP</B>

<DD>
Too many symbolic links were encountered in resolving
<I>pathname</I>,

or <B>O_NOFOLLOW</B> was specified but
<I>pathname</I>

was a symbolic link.
<DT><B>EMFILE</B>

<DD>
The process already has the maximum number of files open.
<DT><B>ENAMETOOLONG</B>

<DD>
<I>pathname</I>

was too long.
<DT><B>ENFILE</B>

<DD>
The system limit on the total number of open files has been reached.
<DT><B>ENODEV</B>

<DD>
<I>pathname</I>

refers to a device special file and no corresponding device exists.
(This is a Linux kernel bug; in this situation ENXIO must be returned.)
<DT><B>ENOENT</B>

<DD>
O_CREAT is not set and the named file does not exist.
Or, a directory component in
<I>pathname</I>

does not exist or is a dangling symbolic link.
<DT><B>ENOMEM</B>

<DD>
Insufficient kernel memory was available.
<DT><B>ENOSPC</B>

<DD>
<I>pathname</I>

was to be created but the device containing
<I>pathname</I>

has no room for the new file.
<DT><B>ENOTDIR</B>

<DD>
A component used as a directory in
<I>pathname</I>

is not, in fact, a directory, or <B>O_DIRECTORY</B> was specified and
<I>pathname</I>

was not a directory.
<DT><B>ENXIO</B>

<DD>
O_NONBLOCK | O_WRONLY is set, the named file is a FIFO and
no process has the file open for reading.
Or, the file is a device special file and no corresponding device exists.
<DT><B>EOVERFLOW</B>

<DD>
<I>pathname</I>

refers to a regular file, too large to be opened; see O_LARGEFILE above.
<DT><B>EPERM</B>

<DD>
The
<B>O_NOATIME</B>

flag was specified, but the effective user ID of the caller

did not match the owner of the file and the caller was not privileged
(<B>CAP_FOWNER</B>).

<DT><B>EROFS</B>

<DD>
<I>pathname</I>

refers to a file on a read-only filesystem and write access was
requested.
<DT><B>ETXTBSY</B>

<DD>
<I>pathname</I>

refers to an executable image which is currently being executed and

</DL>
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NOTE</H2>

Under Linux, the O_NONBLOCK flag indicates that one wants to open
but does not necessarily have the intention to read or write.
This is typically used to open devices in order to get a file descriptor
for use with
<B><A HREF="../man2/ioctl.2.html">ioctl</A></B>(2).

<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>CONFORMING TO</H2>

SVr4, SVID, POSIX, X/OPEN, 4.3BSD.
The
<B>O_NOATIME</B>,

<B>O_NOFOLLOW</B>,

and
<B>O_DIRECTORY</B>

flags are Linux-specific.
One may have to define the
<B>_GNU_SOURCE</B>

macro to get their definitions.
<P>

The (undefined) effect of
<B>O_RDONLY | O_TRUNC</B>

varies among implementations. On many systems the file is actually
truncated.






<P>

The
<B>O_DIRECT</B>

flag was introduced in SGI IRIX, where it has alignment restrictions
similar to those of Linux 2.4.  IRIX has also a <A HREF="../man2/fcntl.2.html">fcntl</A>(2) call to
query appropriate alignments, and sizes.   FreeBSD 4.x introduced
a flag of same name, but without alignment restrictions.
Support was added under Linux in kernel version 2.4.10.
Older Linux kernels simply ignore this flag.
One may have to define the
<B>_GNU_SOURCE</B>

macro to get its definition.
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>BUGS</H2>

&quot;The thing that has always disturbed me about O_DIRECT is that the whole
interface is just stupid, and was probably designed by a deranged monkey
on some serious mind-controlling substances.&quot; --- Linus
<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RESTRICTIONS</H2>

There are many infelicities in the protocol underlying NFS, affecting
amongst others
<B>O_SYNC</B> and <B>O_NDELAY</B>.

<P>
POSIX provides for three different variants of synchronised I/O,
corresponding to the flags <B>O_SYNC</B>, <B>O_DSYNC</B> and
<B>O_RSYNC</B>.  Currently (2.1.130) these are all synonymous under Linux.
