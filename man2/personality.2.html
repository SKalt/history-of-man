<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

Linux supports different execution domains, or personalities, for each
process.
Among other things, execution domains tell Linux how to map
signal numbers into signal actions.
The execution domain system allows
Linux to provide limited support for binaries compiled under other
UNIX-like operating systems.
<P>
This function will return the current
<B>personality</B>()

when
<I>persona</I>

equals 0xffffffff.
Otherwise, it will make the execution domain
referenced by
<I>persona</I>

the new execution domain of the calling process.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

On success, the previous
<I>persona</I>

is returned.
On error, -1 is returned, and
<I>errno</I>

is set appropriately.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

The kernel was unable to change the personality.
