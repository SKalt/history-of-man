<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B>poll</B>()

performs a similar task to
<B><A HREF="../man2/select.2.html">select</A></B>(2):

it waits for one of a set of file descriptors to become ready
to perform I/O.
<P>
The set of file descriptors to be monitored is specified in the
<I>fds</I>

argument, which is an array of structures of the following form:

<PRE>

struct pollfd {
    int   fd;         /* file descriptor */
    short events;     /* requested events */
    short revents;    /* returned events */
};
</PRE>

<P>

The caller should specify the number of items in the
<I>fds</I>

array in
<I>nfds</I>.

<P>
The field
<I>fd</I>

contains a file descriptor for an open file.
If this field is negative, then the corresponding
<I>events</I>

field is ignored and the
<I>revents</I>

field returns zero.
(This provides an easy way of ignoring a
file descriptor for a single
<B>poll</B>()

call: simply negate the
<I>fd</I>

field.
Note, however, that this technique can't be used to ignore file descriptor 0.)
<P>
The field
<I>events</I>

is an input parameter, a bit mask specifying the events the application
is interested in for the file descriptor
<I>fd</I>.

This field may be specified as zero,
in which case the only events that can be returned in
<I>revents</I>

are
<B>POLLHUP</B>,

<B>POLLERR</B>,

and
<B>POLLNVAL</B>

(see below).
<P>
The field
<I>revents</I>

is an output parameter, filled by the kernel with the events that
actually occurred.
The bits returned in
<I>revents</I>

can include any of those specified in
<I>events</I>,

or one of the values
<B>POLLERR</B>,

<B>POLLHUP</B>,

or
<B>POLLNVAL</B>.

(These three bits are meaningless in the
<I>events</I>

field, and will be set in the
<I>revents</I>

field whenever the corresponding condition is true.)
<P>
If none of the events requested (and no error) has occurred for any
of the file descriptors, then
<B>poll</B>()

blocks until one of the events occurs.
<P>
The
<I>timeout</I>

argument specifies the number of milliseconds that
<B>poll</B>()

should block waiting for a file descriptor to become ready.
The call will block until either:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
a file descriptor becomes ready;
<DT>*<DD>
the call is interrupted by a signal handler; or
<DT>*<DD>
the timeout expires.
</DL>
<P>

Note that the
<I>timeout</I>

interval will be rounded up to the system clock granularity,
and kernel scheduling delays mean that the blocking interval
may overrun by a small amount.
Specifying a negative value in
<I>timeout</I>

means an infinite timeout.
Specifying a
<I>timeout</I>

of zero causes
<B>poll</B>()

to return immediately, even if no file descriptors are ready.
<P>
The bits that may be set/returned in
<I>events</I>

and
<I>revents</I>

are defined in <I>&lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/poll.h">poll.h</A>&gt;</I>:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>POLLIN</B>

<DD>
There is data to read.
<DT><B>POLLPRI</B>

<DD>
There is urgent data to read (e.g., out-of-band data on TCP socket;
pseudoterminal master in packet mode has seen state change in slave).
<DT><B>POLLOUT</B>

<DD>
Writing is now possible, though a write larger that the available space
in a socket or pipe will still block (unless
<B>O_NONBLOCK</B>

is set).
<DT><B>POLLRDHUP</B> (since Linux 2.6.17)

<DD>
Stream socket peer closed connection,
or shut down writing half of connection.
The
<B>_GNU_SOURCE</B>

feature test macro must be defined
(before including
<I>any</I>

header files)
in order to obtain this definition.
<DT><B>POLLERR</B>

<DD>
Error condition (only returned in
<I>revents</I>;

ignored in
<I>events</I>).

<DT><B>POLLHUP</B>

<DD>
Hang up (only returned in
<I>revents</I>;

ignored in
<I>events</I>).

Note that when reading from a channel such as a pipe or a stream socket,
this event merely indicates that the peer closed its end of the channel.
Subsequent reads from the channel will return 0 (end of file)
only after all outstanding data in the channel has been consumed.
<DT><B>POLLNVAL</B>

<DD>
Invalid request:
<I>fd</I>

not open (only returned in
<I>revents</I>;

ignored in
<I>events</I>).

</DL>
</DL>

<P>

When compiling with
<B>_XOPEN_SOURCE</B>

defined, one also has the following,
which convey no further information beyond the bits listed above:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>POLLRDNORM</B>

<DD>
Equivalent to
<B>POLLIN</B>.

<DT><B>POLLRDBAND</B>

<DD>
Priority band data can be read (generally unused on Linux).

<DT><B>POLLWRNORM</B>

<DD>
Equivalent to
<B>POLLOUT</B>.

<DT><B>POLLWRBAND</B>

<DD>
Priority data may be written.
</DL>
</DL>

<P>

Linux also knows about, but does not use
<B>POLLMSG</B>.

<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>ppoll()</H3>

The relationship between
<B>poll</B>()

and
<B>ppoll</B>()

is analogous to the relationship between
<B><A HREF="../man2/select.2.html">select</A></B>(2)

and
<B><A HREF="../man2/pselect.2.html">pselect</A></B>(2):

like
<B><A HREF="../man2/pselect.2.html">pselect</A></B>(2),

<B>ppoll</B>()

allows an application to safely wait until either a file descriptor
becomes ready or until a signal is caught.
<P>

Other than the difference in the precision of the
<I>timeout</I>

argument, the following
<B>ppoll</B>()

call:
<PRE>

    ready = ppoll(&amp;fds, nfds, tmo_p, &amp;sigmask);

</PRE>

is equivalent to
<I>atomically</I>

executing the following calls:
<PRE>

    sigset_t origmask;
    int timeout;

    timeout = (tmo_p == NULL) ? -1 :
              (tmo_p-&gt;tv_sec * 1000 + tmo_p-&gt;tv_nsec / 1000000);
    pthread_sigmask(SIG_SETMASK, &amp;sigmask, &amp;origmask);
    ready = poll(&amp;fds, nfds, timeout);
    pthread_sigmask(SIG_SETMASK, &amp;origmask, NULL);
</PRE>

<P>

See the description of
<B><A HREF="../man2/pselect.2.html">pselect</A></B>(2)

for an explanation of why
<B>ppoll</B>()

is necessary.
<P>
If the
<I>sigmask</I>

argument is specified as NULL, then
no signal mask manipulation is performed
(and thus
<B>ppoll</B>()

differs from
<B>poll</B>()

only in the precision of the
<I>timeout</I>

argument).
<P>
The
<I>tmo_p</I>

argument specifies an upper limit on the amount of time that
<B>ppoll</B>()

will block.
This argument is a pointer to a structure of the following form:

<PRE>

struct timespec {
    long    tv_sec;         /* seconds */
    long    tv_nsec;        /* nanoseconds */
};
</PRE>


<P>
If
<I>tmo_p</I>

is specified as NULL, then
<B>ppoll</B>()

can block indefinitely.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

On success, a positive number is returned; this is
the number of structures which have nonzero
<I>revents</I>

fields (in other words, those descriptors with events or errors reported).
A value of 0 indicates that the call timed out and no file
descriptors were ready.
On error, -1 is returned, and
<I>errno</I>

is set appropriately.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EFAULT</B>

<DD>
The array given as argument was not contained in the calling program's
address space.
<DT><B>EINTR</B>

<DD>
A signal occurred before any requested event; see
<B><A HREF="../man7/signal.7.html">signal</A></B>(7).

<DT><B>EINVAL</B>

<DD>
The
<I>nfds</I>

value exceeds the
<B>RLIMIT_NOFILE</B>

value.
<DT><B>ENOMEM</B>

<DD>
There was no space to allocate file descriptor tables.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>VERSIONS</H2>

The
<B>poll</B>()

system call was introduced in Linux 2.1.23.
On older kernels that lack this system call,

the glibc (and the old Linux libc)
<B>poll</B>()

wrapper function provides emulation using
<B><A HREF="../man2/select.2.html">select</A></B>(2).

<P>
The
<B>ppoll</B>()

system call was added to Linux in kernel 2.6.16.
The
<B>ppoll</B>()

library call was added in glibc 2.4.
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>CONFORMING TO</H2>

<B>poll</B>()

conforms to POSIX.1-2001 and POSIX.1-2008.
<B>ppoll</B>()

is Linux-specific.

<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NOTES</H2>

On some other UNIX systems,

<B>poll</B>()

can fail with the error
<B>EAGAIN</B>

if the system fails to allocate kernel-internal resources, rather than
<B>ENOMEM</B>

as Linux does.
POSIX permits this behavior.
Portable programs may wish to check for
<B>EAGAIN</B>

and loop, just as with
<B>EINTR</B>.

<P>
Some implementations define the nonstandard constant
<B>INFTIM</B>

with the value -1 for use as a
<I>timeout</I>

for
<B>poll</B>().

This constant is not provided in glibc.
<P>
For a discussion of what may happen if a file descriptor being monitored by
<B>poll</B>()

is closed in another thread, see
<B><A HREF="../man2/select.2.html">select</A></B>(2).

<A NAME="lbAK">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>C library/kernel differences</H3>

The Linux
<B>ppoll</B>()

system call modifies its
<I>tmo_p</I>

argument.
However, the glibc wrapper function hides this behavior
by using a local variable for the timeout argument that
is passed to the system call.
Thus, the glibc
<B>ppoll</B>()

function does not modify its
<I>tmo_p</I>

argument.
<P>
The raw
<B>ppoll</B>()

system call has a fifth argument,
<I>size_t sigsetsize</I>,

which specifies the size in bytes of the
<I>sigmask</I>

argument.
The glibc
<B>ppoll</B>()

wrapper function specifies this argument as a fixed value
(equal to
<I>sizeof(sigset_t)</I>).
