<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B>prctl</B>()

is called with a first argument describing what to do
(with values defined in <I>&lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/linux/prctl.h">linux/prctl.h</A>&gt;</I>), and further
arguments with a significance depending on the first one.
The first argument can be:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>PR_CAPBSET_READ</B> (since Linux 2.6.25)

<DD>
Return (as the function result) 1 if the capability specified in
<I>arg2</I>

is in the calling thread's capability bounding set,
or 0 if it is not.
(The capability constants are defined in
<I>&lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/linux/capability.h">linux/capability.h</A>&gt;</I>.)

The capability bounding set dictates
whether the process can receive the capability through a
file's permitted capability set on a subsequent call to
<B><A HREF="../man2/execve.2.html">execve</A></B>(2).

<P>
If the capability specified in
<I>arg2</I>

is not valid, then the call fails with the error
<B>EINVAL</B>.

<DT><B>PR_CAPBSET_DROP</B> (since Linux 2.6.25)

<DD>
If the calling thread has the
<B>CAP_SETPCAP</B>

capability, then drop the capability specified by
<I>arg2</I>

from the calling thread's capability bounding set.
Any children of the calling thread will inherit the newly
reduced bounding set.
<P>
The call fails with the error:
<B>EPERM</B>

if the calling thread does not have the
<B>CAP_SETPCAP</B>;

<B>EINVAL</B>

if
<I>arg2</I>

does not represent a valid capability; or
<B>EINVAL</B>

if file capabilities are not enabled in the kernel,
in which case bounding sets are not supported.
<DT><B>PR_SET_DUMPABLE</B> (since Linux 2.3.20)

<DD>
Set the state of the flag determining whether core dumps are produced
for this process upon delivery of a signal whose default behavior is
to produce a core dump.
(Normally this flag is set for a process by default, but it is cleared
when a set-user-ID or set-group-ID program is executed and also by
various system calls that manipulate process UIDs and GIDs).
In kernels up to and including 2.6.12,
<I>arg2</I>

must be either 0 (process is not dumpable) or 1 (process is dumpable).
Between kernels 2.6.13 and 2.6.17, the value 2 was also permitted,
which caused any binary which normally would not be dumped
to be dumped readable by root only;
for security reasons, this feature has been removed.




(See also the description of
<I>/proc/sys/fs/suid_dumpable</I>

in
<B><A HREF="../man5/proc.5.html">proc</A></B>(5).)

<DT><B>PR_GET_DUMPABLE</B> (since Linux 2.3.20)

<DD>
Return (as the function result) the current state of the calling
process's dumpable flag.



<DT><B>PR_SET_ENDIAN</B> (since Linux 2.6.18, PowerPC only)

<DD>
Set the endian-ness of the calling process to the value given
in <I>arg2</I>, which should be one of the following:

<B>PR_ENDIAN_BIG</B>,

<B>PR_ENDIAN_LITTLE</B>,

or
<B>PR_ENDIAN_PPC_LITTLE</B>

(PowerPC pseudo little endian).
<DT><B>PR_GET_ENDIAN</B> (since Linux 2.6.18, PowerPC only)

<DD>
Return the endian-ness of the calling process,
in the location pointed to by
<I>(int&nbsp;*) arg2</I>.

<DT><B>PR_SET_FPEMU</B> (since Linux 2.4.18, 2.5.9, only on ia64)

<DD>
Set floating-point emulation control bits to <I>arg2</I>.
Pass <B>PR_FPEMU_NOPRINT</B> to silently emulate fp operations accesses, or
<B>PR_FPEMU_SIGFPE</B> to not emulate fp operations and send
<B>SIGFPE</B>

instead.
<DT><B>PR_GET_FPEMU</B> (since Linux 2.4.18, 2.5.9, only on ia64)

<DD>
Return floating-point emulation control bits,
in the location pointed to by
<I>(int&nbsp;*) arg2</I>.

<DT><B>PR_SET_FPEXC</B> (since Linux 2.4.21, 2.5.32, only on PowerPC)

<DD>
Set floating-point exception mode to <I>arg2</I>.
Pass <B>PR_FP_EXC_SW_ENABLE</B> to use FPEXC for FP exception enables,
<B>PR_FP_EXC_DIV</B> for floating-point divide by zero,
<B>PR_FP_EXC_OVF</B> for floating-point overflow,
<B>PR_FP_EXC_UND</B> for floating-point underflow,
<B>PR_FP_EXC_RES</B> for floating-point inexact result,
<B>PR_FP_EXC_INV</B> for floating-point invalid operation,
<B>PR_FP_EXC_DISABLED</B> for FP exceptions disabled,
<B>PR_FP_EXC_NONRECOV</B> for async non-recoverable exception mode,
<B>PR_FP_EXC_ASYNC</B> for async recoverable exception mode,
<B>PR_FP_EXC_PRECISE</B> for precise exception mode.
<DT><B>PR_GET_FPEXC</B> (since Linux 2.4.21, 2.5.32, only on PowerPC)

<DD>
Return floating-point exception mode,
in the location pointed to by
<I>(int&nbsp;*) arg2</I>.

<DT><B>PR_SET_KEEPCAPS</B> (since Linux 2.2.18)

<DD>
Set the state of the thread's &quot;keep capabilities&quot; flag,
which determines whether the threads's effective and permitted
capability sets are cleared when a change is made to the threads's user IDs
such that the threads's real UID, effective UID, and saved set-user-ID
all become non-zero when at least one of them previously had the value 0.
(By default, these credential sets are cleared).
<I>arg2</I>

must be either 0 (capabilities are cleared) or 1 (capabilities are kept).
This value will be reset to 0 on subsequent calls to
<B><A HREF="../man2/execve.2.html">execve</A></B>(2).

<DT><B>PR_GET_KEEPCAPS</B> (since Linux 2.2.18)

<DD>
Return (as the function result) the current state of the calling threads's
&quot;keep capabilities&quot; flag.
<DT><B>PR_SET_NAME</B> (since Linux 2.6.9)

<DD>
Set the process name for the calling process,
using the value in the location pointed to by
<I>(char&nbsp;*) arg2</I>.

The name can be up to 16 bytes long,

and should be null terminated if it contains fewer bytes.
<DT><B>PR_GET_NAME</B> (since Linux 2.6.11)

<DD>
Return the process name for the calling process,
in the buffer pointed to by
<I>(char&nbsp;*) arg2</I>.

The buffer should allow space for up to 16 bytes;
the returned string will be null terminated if it is shorter than that.
<DT><B>PR_SET_PDEATHSIG</B> (since Linux 2.1.57)

<DD>
Set the parent process death signal
of the calling process to <I>arg2</I> (either a signal value
in the range 1..maxsig, or 0 to clear).
This is the signal that the calling process will get when its
parent dies.
This value is cleared for the child of a
<B><A HREF="../man2/fork.2.html">fork</A></B>(2).

<DT><B>PR_GET_PDEATHSIG</B> (since Linux 2.3.15)

<DD>
Return the current value of the parent process death signal,
in the location pointed to by
<I>(int&nbsp;*) arg2</I>.

<DT><B>PR_SET_SECCOMP</B> (since Linux 2.6.23)

<DD>



Set the secure computing mode for the calling thread.
In the current implementation,
<I>arg2</I>

must be 1.
After the secure computing mode has been set to 1,
the only system calls that the thread is permitted to make are
<B><A HREF="../man2/read.2.html">read</A></B>(2),

<B><A HREF="../man2/write.2.html">write</A></B>(2),

<B><A HREF="../man2/_exit.2.html">_exit</A></B>(2),

and
<B><A HREF="../man2/sigreturn.2.html">sigreturn</A></B>(2).

Other system calls result in the delivery of a
<B>SIGKILL</B>

signal.
Secure computing mode is useful for number-crunching applications
that may need to execute untrusted byte code,
perhaps obtained by reading from a pipe or socket.
This operation is only available
if the kernel is configured with CONFIG_SECCOMP enabled.
<DT><B>PR_GET_SECCOMP</B> (since Linux 2.6.23)

<DD>
Return the secure computing mode of the calling thread.
Not very useful for the current implementation (mode equals 1),
but may be useful for other possible future modes:
if the caller is not in secure computing mode, this operation returns 0;
if the caller is in secure computing mode, then the
<B>prctl</B>()

call will cause a
<B>SIGKILL</B>

signal to be sent to the process.
This operation is only available
if the kernel is configured with CONFIG_SECCOMP enabled.
<DT><B>PR_SET_SECUREBITS</B> (since Linux 2.6.26)

<DD>
Set the &quot;securebits&quot; flags of the calling thread to the value supplied in
<I>arg2</I>.

See
<B><A HREF="../man7/capabilities.7.html">capabilities</A></B>(7).

<DT><B>PR_GET_SECUREBITS</B> (since Linux 2.6.26)

<DD>
Return (as the function result)
the &quot;securebits&quot; flags of the calling thread.
See
<B><A HREF="../man7/capabilities.7.html">capabilities</A></B>(7).

<DT><B>PR_SET_TIMING</B> (since Linux 2.6.0-test4)

<DD>
Set whether to use (normal, traditional) statistical process timing or
accurate timestamp based process timing, by passing
<B>PR_TIMING_STATISTICAL</B>


or
<B>PR_TIMING_TIMESTAMP</B>


to <I>arg2</I>.
<B>PR_TIMING_TIMESTAMP</B>

is not currently implemented
(attempting to set this mode will yield the error
<B>EINVAL</B>).




<DT><B>PR_GET_TIMING</B> (since Linux 2.6.0-test4)

<DD>
Return (as the function result) which process timing method is currently
in use.
<DT><B>PR_SET_TSC</B> (since Linux 2.6.26, x86 only)

<DD>
Set the state of the flag determining whether the timestamp counter
can be read by the process.
Pass
<B>PR_TSC_ENABLE</B>

to
<I>arg2</I>

to allow it to be read, or
<B>PR_TSC_SIGSEGV</B>

to generate a
<B>SIGSEGV</B>

when the process tries to read the timestamp counter.
<DT><B>PR_GET_TSC</B> (since Linux 2.6.26, x86 only)

<DD>
Return the state of the flag determining whether the timestamp counter
can be read,
in the location pointed to by
<I>(int&nbsp;*) arg2</I>.

<DT><B>PR_SET_UNALIGN</B>

<DD>
(Only on: ia64, since Linux 2.3.48; parisc, since Linux 2.6.15;
PowerPC, since Linux 2.6.18; Alpha, since Linux 2.6.22)
Set unaligned access control bits to <I>arg2</I>.
Pass
<B>PR_UNALIGN_NOPRINT</B> to silently fix up unaligned user accesses,
or <B>PR_UNALIGN_SIGBUS</B> to generate
<B>SIGBUS</B>

on unaligned user access.
<DT><B>PR_GET_UNALIGN</B>

<DD>
(see
<B>PR_SET_UNALIGN</B>

for information on versions and architectures)
Return unaligned access control bits, in the location pointed to by
<I>(int&nbsp;*) arg2</I>.
