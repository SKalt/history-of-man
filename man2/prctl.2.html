<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B>prctl</B>

is called with a first argument describing what to do
(with values defined in &lt;<I>linux/prctl.h</I>&gt;), and further
parameters with a significance depending on the first one.
The first argument can be:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>PR_SET_PDEATHSIG</B>

<DD>
(since Linux 2.1.57)
Set the parent process death signal
of the current process to <I>arg2</I> (either a signal value
in the range 1..maxsig, or 0 to clear).
This is the signal that the current process will get when its
parent dies. This value is cleared upon a fork().
<DT><B>PR_GET_PDEATHSIG</B>

<DD>
(since Linux 2.3.15)
Read the current value of the parent process death signal
into the (int *) <I>arg2</I>.
<DT><B>PR_SET_DUMPABLE</B>

<DD>
(Since Linux 2.4)
Set the state of the flag determining whether core dumps are produced
for this process upon delivery of a signal whose default behaviour is
to produce a core dump.
(Normally this flag is set for a process by default, but it is cleared
when a set-user-ID or set-group-ID program is executed and also by 
various system calls that manipulate process UIDs and GIDs).
<I>arg2</I>

must be either 0 (process is not dumpable) or 1 (process is dumpable).
<DT><B>PR_GET_DUMPABLE</B>

<DD>
(Since Linux 2.4)
Return (as the function result) the current state of the calling
process's dumpable flag.
<DT><B>PR_SET_KEEPCAPS</B>

<DD>
Set the state of the process's &quot;keep capabilities&quot; flag,
which determines whether the process's effective and permitted
capability sets are cleared when a change is made to the process's user IDs
such that the process's real UID, effective UID, and saved set-user-ID
all become non-zero when at least one of them previously had the value 0.
(By default, these credential sets are cleared).
<I>arg2</I>

must be either 0 (capabilities are cleared) or 1 (capabilities are kept).
<DT><B>PR_GET_KEEPCAPS</B>

<DD>
Return (as the function result) the current state of the calling process's
&quot;keep capabilities&quot; flag.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

<B>PR_GET_DUMPABLE</B>

and
<B>PR_GET_KEEPCAPS</B>

return 0 or 1 on success.
All other
<I>option</I>

values return 0 on success.
On error, -1 is returned, and
<I>errno</I>

is set appropriately.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EINVAL</B>

<DD>
The value of
<I>option</I>

is not recognized, or it is
<B>PR_SET_PDEATHSIG</B>

and
<I>arg2</I>

is not zero or a signal number.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>CONFORMING TO</H2>

This call is Linux-specific.
IRIX has a prctl system call (also introduced in Linux 2.1.44
as irix_prctl on the MIPS architecture),
with prototype
<P>
<B>ptrdiff_t prctl(int </B><I>option</I><B>, int </B><I>arg2</I><B>, int </B><I>arg3</I><B>);</B>

<P>
and options to get the maximum number of processes per user,
get the maximum number of processors the calling process can use,
find out whether a specified process is currently blocked,
get or set the maximum stack size, etc.
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>AVAILABILITY</H2>

The prctl() system call was introduced in Linux 2.1.57.
There is no prctl() library call as yet.
