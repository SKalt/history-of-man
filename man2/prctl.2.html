<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B>prctl</B>()

is called with a first argument describing what to do
(with values defined in <I>&lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/linux/prctl.h">linux/prctl.h</A>&gt;</I>), and further
arguments with a significance depending on the first one.
The first argument can be:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>PR_CAPBSET_READ</B> (since Linux 2.6.25)

<DD>
Return (as the function result) 1 if the capability specified in
<I>arg2</I>

is in the calling thread's capability bounding set,
or 0 if it is not.
(The capability constants are defined in
<I>&lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/linux/capability.h">linux/capability.h</A>&gt;</I>.)

The capability bounding set dictates
whether the process can receive the capability through a
file's permitted capability set on a subsequent call to
<B><A HREF="../man2/execve.2.html">execve</A></B>(2).

<P>
If the capability specified in
<I>arg2</I>

is not valid, then the call fails with the error
<B>EINVAL</B>.

<DT><B>PR_CAPBSET_DROP</B> (since Linux 2.6.25)

<DD>
If the calling thread has the
<B>CAP_SETPCAP</B>

capability, then drop the capability specified by
<I>arg2</I>

from the calling thread's capability bounding set.
Any children of the calling thread will inherit the newly
reduced bounding set.
<P>
The call fails with the error:
<B>EPERM</B>

if the calling thread does not have the
<B>CAP_SETPCAP</B>;

<B>EINVAL</B>

if
<I>arg2</I>

does not represent a valid capability; or
<B>EINVAL</B>

if file capabilities are not enabled in the kernel,
in which case bounding sets are not supported.
<DT><B>PR_SET_CHILD_SUBREAPER</B> (since Linux 3.4)

<DD>

If
<I>arg2</I>

is nonzero,
set the &quot;child subreaper&quot; attribute of the calling process;
if
<I>arg2</I>

is zero, unset the attribute.
When a process is marked as a child subreaper,
all of the children that it creates, and their descendants,
will be marked as having a subreaper.
In effect, a subreaper fulfills the role of
<B><A HREF="../man1/init.1.html">init</A></B>(1)

for its descendant processes.
Upon termination of a process
that is orphaned (i.e., its immediate parent has already terminated)
and marked as having a subreaper,
the nearest still living ancestor subreaper
will receive a
<B>SIGCHLD</B>

signal and be able to
<B><A HREF="../man2/wait.2.html">wait</A></B>(2)

on the process to discover its termination status.
<DT><B>PR_GET_CHILD_SUBREAPER</B> (since Linux 3.4)

<DD>
Return the &quot;child subreaper&quot; setting of the caller,
in the location pointed to by
<I>(int&nbsp;*) arg2</I>.

<DT><B>PR_SET_DUMPABLE</B> (since Linux 2.3.20)

<DD>
Set the state of the flag determining whether core dumps are produced
for the calling process upon delivery of a signal whose default behavior is
to produce a core dump.
(Normally, this flag is set for a process by default, but it is cleared
when a set-user-ID or set-group-ID program is executed and also by
various system calls that manipulate process UIDs and GIDs).
In kernels up to and including 2.6.12,
<I>arg2</I>

must be either 0 (process is not dumpable) or 1 (process is dumpable).
Between kernels 2.6.13 and 2.6.17, the value 2 was also permitted,
which caused any binary which normally would not be dumped
to be dumped readable by root only;
for security reasons, this feature has been removed.




(See also the description of
<I>/proc/sys/fs/suid_dumpable</I>

in
<B><A HREF="../man5/proc.5.html">proc</A></B>(5).)

Processes that are not dumpable can not be attached via
<B><A HREF="../man2/ptrace.2.html">ptrace</A></B>(2)

<B>PTRACE_ATTACH</B>.

<DT><B>PR_GET_DUMPABLE</B> (since Linux 2.3.20)

<DD>
Return (as the function result) the current state of the calling
process's dumpable flag.



<DT><B>PR_SET_ENDIAN</B> (since Linux 2.6.18, PowerPC only)

<DD>
Set the endian-ness of the calling process to the value given
in <I>arg2</I>, which should be one of the following:

<B>PR_ENDIAN_BIG</B>,

<B>PR_ENDIAN_LITTLE</B>,

or
<B>PR_ENDIAN_PPC_LITTLE</B>

(PowerPC pseudo little endian).
<DT><B>PR_GET_ENDIAN</B> (since Linux 2.6.18, PowerPC only)

<DD>
Return the endian-ness of the calling process,
in the location pointed to by
<I>(int&nbsp;*) arg2</I>.

<DT><B>PR_SET_FPEMU</B> (since Linux 2.4.18, 2.5.9, only on ia64)

<DD>
Set floating-point emulation control bits to <I>arg2</I>.
Pass <B>PR_FPEMU_NOPRINT</B> to silently emulate fp operations accesses, or
<B>PR_FPEMU_SIGFPE</B> to not emulate fp operations and send
<B>SIGFPE</B>

instead.
<DT><B>PR_GET_FPEMU</B> (since Linux 2.4.18, 2.5.9, only on ia64)

<DD>
Return floating-point emulation control bits,
in the location pointed to by
<I>(int&nbsp;*) arg2</I>.

<DT><B>PR_SET_FPEXC</B> (since Linux 2.4.21, 2.5.32, only on PowerPC)

<DD>
Set floating-point exception mode to <I>arg2</I>.
Pass <B>PR_FP_EXC_SW_ENABLE</B> to use FPEXC for FP exception enables,
<B>PR_FP_EXC_DIV</B> for floating-point divide by zero,
<B>PR_FP_EXC_OVF</B> for floating-point overflow,
<B>PR_FP_EXC_UND</B> for floating-point underflow,
<B>PR_FP_EXC_RES</B> for floating-point inexact result,
<B>PR_FP_EXC_INV</B> for floating-point invalid operation,
<B>PR_FP_EXC_DISABLED</B> for FP exceptions disabled,
<B>PR_FP_EXC_NONRECOV</B> for async nonrecoverable exception mode,
<B>PR_FP_EXC_ASYNC</B> for async recoverable exception mode,
<B>PR_FP_EXC_PRECISE</B> for precise exception mode.
<DT><B>PR_GET_FPEXC</B> (since Linux 2.4.21, 2.5.32, only on PowerPC)

<DD>
Return floating-point exception mode,
in the location pointed to by
<I>(int&nbsp;*) arg2</I>.

<DT><B>PR_SET_KEEPCAPS</B> (since Linux 2.2.18)

<DD>
Set the state of the thread's &quot;keep capabilities&quot; flag,
which determines whether the threads's permitted
capability set is cleared when a change is made to the threads's user IDs
such that the threads's real UID, effective UID, and saved set-user-ID
all become nonzero when at least one of them previously had the value 0.
By default, the permitted capability set is cleared when such a change is made;
setting the &quot;keep capabilities&quot; flag prevents it from being cleared.
<I>arg2</I>

must be either 0 (permitted capabilities are cleared)
or 1 (permitted capabilities are kept).
(A thread's
<I>effective</I>

capability set is always cleared when such a credential change is made,
regardless of the setting of the &quot;keep capabilities&quot; flag.)
The &quot;keep capabilities&quot; value will be reset to 0 on subsequent calls to
<B><A HREF="../man2/execve.2.html">execve</A></B>(2).

<DT><B>PR_GET_KEEPCAPS</B> (since Linux 2.2.18)

<DD>
Return (as the function result) the current state of the calling threads's
&quot;keep capabilities&quot; flag.
<DT><B>PR_SET_NAME</B> (since Linux 2.6.9)

<DD>
Set the name of the calling thread,
using the value in the location pointed to by
<I>(char&nbsp;*) arg2</I>.

The name can be up to 16 bytes long,

and should be null-terminated if it contains fewer bytes.
This is the same attribute that can be set via
<B><A HREF="../man3/pthread_setname_np.3.html">pthread_setname_np</A></B>(3)

and retrieved using
<B><A HREF="../man3/pthread_getname_np.3.html">pthread_getname_np</A></B>(3).

The attribute is likewise accessible via
<I>/proc/self/task/[tid]/comm</I>,

where
<I>tid</I>

is the name of the calling thread.
<DT><B>PR_GET_NAME</B> (since Linux 2.6.11)

<DD>
Return the name of the calling thread,
in the buffer pointed to by
<I>(char&nbsp;*) arg2</I>.

The buffer should allow space for up to 16 bytes;
the returned string will be null-terminated if it is shorter than that.
<DT><B>PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS</B> (since Linux 3.5)

<DD>
Set the calling process's
<I>no_new_privs</I>

bit to the value in
<I>arg2</I>.

With
<I>no_new_privs</I>

set to 1,
<B><A HREF="../man2/execve.2.html">execve</A></B>(2)

promises not to grant privileges to do anything
that could not have been done without the
<B><A HREF="../man2/execve.2.html">execve</A></B>(2)

call (for example,
rendering the set-user-ID and set-group-ID permission bits,
and file capabilities non-functional).
Once set, this bit cannot be unset.
The setting of this bit is inherited by children created by
<B><A HREF="../man2/fork.2.html">fork</A></B>(2)

and
<B><A HREF="../man2/clone.2.html">clone</A></B>(2),

and preserved across
<B><A HREF="../man2/execve.2.html">execve</A></B>(2).

<P>
For more information, see the kernel source file
<I>Documentation/prctl/no_new_privs.txt</I>.

<DT><B>PR_GET_NO_NEW_PRIVS</B> (since Linux 3.5)

<DD>
Return (as the function result) the value of the
<I>no_new_privs</I>

bit for the current process.
A value of 0 indicates the regular
<B><A HREF="../man2/execve.2.html">execve</A></B>(2)

behavior.
A value of 1 indicates
<B><A HREF="../man2/execve.2.html">execve</A></B>(2)

will operate in the privilege-restricting mode described above.
<DT><B>PR_SET_PDEATHSIG</B> (since Linux 2.1.57)

<DD>
Set the parent process death signal
of the calling process to <I>arg2</I> (either a signal value
in the range 1..maxsig, or 0 to clear).
This is the signal that the calling process will get when its
parent dies.
This value is cleared for the child of a
<B><A HREF="../man2/fork.2.html">fork</A></B>(2)

and (since Linux 2.4.36 / 2.6.23)
when executing a set-user-ID or set-group-ID binary.
This value is preserved across
<B><A HREF="../man2/execve.2.html">execve</A></B>(2).

<DT><B>PR_GET_PDEATHSIG</B> (since Linux 2.3.15)

<DD>
Return the current value of the parent process death signal,
in the location pointed to by
<I>(int&nbsp;*) arg2</I>.

<DT><B>PR_SET_PTRACER</B> (since Linux 3.4)

<DD>


This is meaningful only when the Yama LSM is enabled and in mode 1
(&quot;restricted ptrace&quot;, visible via
<I>/proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope</I>).

When a &quot;ptracer process ID&quot; is passed in <I>arg2</I>,
the caller is declaring that the ptracer process can
<B><A HREF="../man2/ptrace.2.html">ptrace</A></B>(2)

the calling process as if it were a direct process ancestor.
Each
<B>PR_SET_PTRACER</B>

operation replaces the previous &quot;ptracer process ID&quot;.
Employing
<B>PR_SET_PTRACER</B>

with
<I>arg2</I>

set to 0 clears the caller's &quot;ptracer process ID&quot;.
If
<I>arg2</I>

is
<B>PR_SET_PTRACER_ANY</B>,

the ptrace restrictions introduced by Yama are effectively disabled for the
calling process.
<P>
For further information, see the kernel source file
<I>Documentation/security/Yama.txt</I>.

<DT><B>PR_SET_SECCOMP</B> (since Linux 2.6.23)

<DD>



Set the secure computing (seccomp) mode for the calling thread, to limit
the available system calls.
The seccomp mode is selected via
<I>arg2</I>.

(The seccomp constants are defined in
<I>&lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/linux/seccomp.h">linux/seccomp.h</A>&gt;</I>.)

<P>
With
<I>arg2</I>

set to
<B>SECCOMP_MODE_STRICT</B>

the only system calls that the thread is permitted to make are
<B><A HREF="../man2/read.2.html">read</A></B>(2),

<B><A HREF="../man2/write.2.html">write</A></B>(2),

<B><A HREF="../man2/_exit.2.html">_exit</A></B>(2),

and
<B><A HREF="../man2/sigreturn.2.html">sigreturn</A></B>(2).

Other system calls result in the delivery of a
<B>SIGKILL</B>

signal.
Strict secure computing mode is useful for number-crunching applications
that may need to execute untrusted byte code,
perhaps obtained by reading from a pipe or socket.
This operation is available only
if the kernel is configured with
<B>CONFIG_SECCOMP</B>

enabled.
<P>
With
<I>arg2</I>

set to
<B>SECCOMP_MODE_FILTER</B> (since Linux 3.5)

the system calls allowed are defined by a pointer
to a Berkeley Packet Filter passed in
<I>arg3</I>.

This argument is a pointer to
<I>struct sock_fprog</I>;

it can be designed to filter
arbitrary system calls and system call arguments.
This mode is available only if the kernel is configured with
<B>CONFIG_SECCOMP_FILTER</B>

enabled.
<P>
If
<B>SECCOMP_MODE_FILTER</B>

filters permit
<B><A HREF="../man2/fork.2.html">fork</A></B>(2),

then the seccomp mode is inherited by children created by
<B><A HREF="../man2/fork.2.html">fork</A></B>(2);

if
<B><A HREF="../man2/execve.2.html">execve</A></B>(2)

is permitted, then the seccomp mode is preserved across
<B><A HREF="../man2/execve.2.html">execve</A></B>(2).

If the filters permit
<B>prctl</B>()

calls, then additional filters can be added;
they are run in order until the first non-allow result is seen.
<P>
For further information, see the kernel source file
<I>Documentation/prctl/seccomp_filter.txt</I>.

<DT><B>PR_GET_SECCOMP</B> (since Linux 2.6.23)

<DD>
Return (as the function result)
the secure computing mode of the calling thread.
If the caller is not in secure computing mode, this operation returns 0;
if the caller is in strict secure computing mode, then the
<B>prctl</B>()

call will cause a
<B>SIGKILL</B>

signal to be sent to the process.
If the caller is in filter mode, and this system call is allowed by the
seccomp filters, it returns 2.
This operation is available only
if the kernel is configured with
<B>CONFIG_SECCOMP</B>

enabled.
<DT><B>PR_SET_SECUREBITS</B> (since Linux 2.6.26)

<DD>
Set the &quot;securebits&quot; flags of the calling thread to the value supplied in
<I>arg2</I>.

See
<B><A HREF="../man7/capabilities.7.html">capabilities</A></B>(7).

<DT><B>PR_GET_SECUREBITS</B> (since Linux 2.6.26)

<DD>
Return (as the function result)
the &quot;securebits&quot; flags of the calling thread.
See
<B><A HREF="../man7/capabilities.7.html">capabilities</A></B>(7).

<DT><B>PR_SET_THP_DISABLE</B> (since Linux 3.15)

<DD>

Set the state of the &quot;THP disable&quot; flag for the calling thread.
If
<I>arg2</I>

has a nonzero value, the flag is set, otherwise it is cleared.
Setting this flag provides a method
for disabling transparent huge pages
for jobs where the code cannot be modified, and using a malloc hook with
<B><A HREF="../man2/madvise.2.html">madvise</A></B>(2)

is not an option (i.e., statically allocated data).
The setting of the &quot;THP disable&quot; flag is inherited by a child created via
<B><A HREF="../man2/fork.2.html">fork</A></B>(2)

and is preserved across
<B><A HREF="../man2/execve.2.html">execve</A></B>(2).

<DT><B>PR_GET_THP_DISABLE</B> (since Linux 3.15)

<DD>
Return (via the function result) the current setting of the &quot;THP disable&quot;
flag for the calling thread:
either 1, if the flag is set, or 0, if it is not.
<DT><B>PR_GET_TID_ADDRESS</B> (since Linux 3.5)

<DD>

Retrieve the
<I>clear_child_tid</I>

address set by
<B><A HREF="../man2/set_tid_address.2.html">set_tid_address</A></B>(2)

and the
<B><A HREF="../man2/clone.2.html">clone</A></B>(2)

<B>CLONE_CHILD_CLEARTID</B>

flag, in the location pointed to by
<I>(int&nbsp;**)&nbsp;arg2</I>.

This feature is available only if the kernel is built with the
<B>CONFIG_CHECKPOINT_RESTORE</B>

option enabled.
<DT><B>PR_SET_TIMERSLACK</B> (since Linux 2.6.28)

<DD>


Set the current timer slack for the calling thread to the nanosecond value
supplied in
<I>arg2</I>.

If
<I>arg2</I>

is less than or equal to zero,


reset the current timer slack to the thread's default timer slack value.
The timer slack is used by the kernel to group timer expirations
for the calling thread that are close to one another;
as a consequence, timer expirations for the thread may be
up to the specified number of nanoseconds late (but will never expire early).
Grouping timer expirations can help reduce system power consumption
by minimizing CPU wake-ups.
<P>
The timer expirations affected by timer slack are those set by
<B><A HREF="../man2/select.2.html">select</A></B>(2),

<B><A HREF="../man2/pselect.2.html">pselect</A></B>(2),

<B><A HREF="../man2/poll.2.html">poll</A></B>(2),

<B><A HREF="../man2/nanosleep.2.html">nanosleep</A></B>(2),

and
<B><A HREF="../man2/futex.2.html">futex</A></B>(2)

(and thus the library functions implemented via futexes, including

<B><A HREF="../man3/pthread_cond_timedwait.3.html">pthread_cond_timedwait</A></B>(3),

<B><A HREF="../man3/pthread_mutex_timedlock.3.html">pthread_mutex_timedlock</A></B>(3),

<B><A HREF="../man3/pthread_rwlock_timedwrlock.3.html">pthread_rwlock_timedwrlock</A></B>(3),

and
<B><A HREF="../man3/sem_timedwait.3.html">sem_timedwait</A></B>(3)).

<P>
Timer slack is not applied to threads that are scheduled under
a real-time scheduling policy (see
<B><A HREF="../man2/sched_setscheduler.2.html">sched_setscheduler</A></B>(2)).

<P>
Each thread has two associated timer slack values:
a &quot;default&quot; value, and a &quot;current&quot; value.
The current value is the one that governs grouping
of timer expirations.
When a new thread is created,
the two timer slack values are made the same as the current value
of the creating thread.
Thereafter, a thread can adjust its current timer slack value via
<B>PR_SET_TIMERSLACK</B>

(the default value can't be changed).
The timer slack values of
<I>init</I>

(PID 1), the ancestor of all processes,
are 50,000 nanoseconds (50 microseconds).
The timer slack values are preserved across
<B><A HREF="../man2/execve.2.html">execve</A></B>(2).

<DT><B>PR_GET_TIMERSLACK</B> (since Linux 2.6.28)

<DD>
Return (as the function result)
the current timer slack value of the calling thread.
<DT><B>PR_SET_TIMING</B> (since Linux 2.6.0-test4)

<DD>
Set whether to use (normal, traditional) statistical process timing or
accurate timestamp-based process timing, by passing
<B>PR_TIMING_STATISTICAL</B>


or
<B>PR_TIMING_TIMESTAMP</B>


to <I>arg2</I>.
<B>PR_TIMING_TIMESTAMP</B>

is not currently implemented
(attempting to set this mode will yield the error
<B>EINVAL</B>).




<DT><B>PR_GET_TIMING</B> (since Linux 2.6.0-test4)

<DD>
Return (as the function result) which process timing method is currently
in use.
<DT><B>PR_TASK_PERF_EVENTS_DISABLE</B> (since Linux 2.6.31)

<DD>
Disable all performance counters attached to the calling process,
regardless of whether the counters were created by
this process or another process.
Performance counters created by the calling process for other
processes are unaffected.
For more information on performance counters, see the Linux kernel source file
<I>tools/perf/design.txt</I>.

<DT><B>PR_SET_TSC</B> (since Linux 2.6.26, x86 only)

<DD>
Set the state of the flag determining whether the timestamp counter
can be read by the process.
Pass
<B>PR_TSC_ENABLE</B>

to
<I>arg2</I>

to allow it to be read, or
<B>PR_TSC_SIGSEGV</B>

to generate a

<B><A HREF="../man5/proc.5.html">proc</A></B>(5).)

If
<I>arg2</I>

is
<B>PR_MCE_KILL_SET</B>,

use a thread-specific memory corruption kill policy.
In this case,
<I>arg3</I>

defines whether the policy is
<I>early kill</I>

(<B>PR_MCE_KILL_EARLY</B>),

<I>late kill</I>

(<B>PR_MCE_KILL_LATE</B>),

or the system-wide default
(<B>PR_MCE_KILL_DEFAULT</B>).

Early kill means that the thread receives a
<B>SIGBUS</B>

signal as soon as hardware memory corruption is detected inside
its address space.
In late kill mode, the process is killed only when it accesses a corrupted page.
See
<B><A HREF="../man2/sigaction.2.html">sigaction</A></B>(2)

for more information on the
<B>SIGBUS</B>

signal.
The policy is inherited by children.
The remaining unused
<B>prctl</B>()

arguments must be zero for future compatibility.
<DT><B>PR_MCE_KILL_GET</B> (since Linux 2.6.32)

<DD>
Return the current per-process machine check kill policy.
All unused
<B>prctl</B>()

arguments must be zero.
<DT><B>PR_SET_MM</B> (since Linux 3.3)

<DD>

Modify certain kernel memory map descriptor fields
of the calling process.
Usually these fields are set by the kernel and dynamic loader (see
<B><A HREF="../man8/ld.so.8.html">ld.so</A></B>(8)

for more information) and a regular application should not use this feature.
However, there are cases, such as self-modifying programs,
where a program might find it useful to change its own memory map.
This feature is available only if the kernel is built with the
<B>CONFIG_CHECKPOINT_RESTORE</B>

option enabled.
The calling process must have the
<B>CAP_SYS_RESOURCE</B>

capability.
The value in
<I>arg2</I>

is one of the options below, while
<I>arg3</I>

provides a new value for the option.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>PR_SET_MM_START_CODE</B>

<DD>
Set the address above which the program text can run.
The corresponding memory area must be readable and executable,
but not writable or sharable (see
<B><A HREF="../man2/mprotect.2.html">mprotect</A></B>(2)

and
<B><A HREF="../man2/mmap.2.html">mmap</A></B>(2)

for more information).
<DT><B>PR_SET_MM_END_CODE</B>

<DD>
Set the address below which the program text can run.
The corresponding memory area must be readable and executable,
but not writable or sharable.
<DT><B>PR_SET_MM_START_DATA</B>

<DD>
Set the address above which initialized and
uninitialized (bss) data are placed.
The corresponding memory area must be readable and writable,
but not executable or sharable.
<DT><B>PR_SET_MM_END_DATA</B>

<DD>
Set the address below which initialized and
uninitialized (bss) data are placed.
The corresponding memory area must be readable and writable,
but not executable or sharable.
<DT><B>PR_SET_MM_START_STACK</B>

<DD>
Set the start address of the stack.
The corresponding memory area must be readable and writable.
<DT><B>PR_SET_MM_START_BRK</B>

<DD>
Set the address above which the program heap can be expanded with
<B><A HREF="../man2/brk.2.html">brk</A></B>(2)

call.
The address must be greater than the ending address of
the current program data segment.
In addition, the combined size of the resulting heap and
the size of the data segment can't exceed the
<B>RLIMIT_DATA</B>

resource limit (see
<B><A HREF="../man2/setrlimit.2.html">setrlimit</A></B>(2)).

<DT><B>PR_SET_MM_BRK</B>

<DD>
Set the current
<B><A HREF="../man2/brk.2.html">brk</A></B>(2)

value.
The requirements for the address are the same as for the
<B>PR_SET_MM_START_BRK</B>

option.
</DL>
<P>

The following options are available since Linux 3.5.

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>PR_SET_MM_ARG_START</B>

<DD>
Set the address above which the program command line is placed.
<DT><B>PR_SET_MM_ARG_END</B>

<DD>
Set the address below which the program command line is placed.
<DT><B>PR_SET_MM_ENV_START</B>

<DD>
Set the address above which the program environment is placed.
<DT><B>PR_SET_MM_ENV_END</B>

<DD>
Set the address below which the program environment is placed.
<DT><DD>
The address passed with
<B>PR_SET_MM_ARG_START</B>,

<B>PR_SET_MM_ARG_END</B>,

<B>PR_SET_MM_ENV_START</B>,

and
<B>PR_SET_MM_ENV_END</B>

should belong to a process stack area.
Thus, the corresponding memory area must be readable, writable, and
(depending on the kernel configuration) have the
<B>MAP_GROWSDOWN</B>

attribute set (see
<B><A HREF="../man2/mmap.2.html">mmap</A></B>(2)).

<DT><B>PR_SET_MM_AUXV</B>

<DD>
Set a new auxiliary vector.
The
<I>arg3</I>

argument should provide the address of the vector.
The
<I>arg4</I>

is the size of the vector.
<DT><B>PR_SET_MM_EXE_FILE</B>

<DD>

Supersede the
<I>/proc/pid/exe</I>

symbolic link with a new one pointing to a new executable file
identified by the file descriptor provided in
<I>arg3</I>

argument.
The file descriptor should be obtained with a regular
<B><A HREF="../man2/open.2.html">open</A></B>(2)

call.
<DT><DD>
To change the symbolic link, one needs to unmap all existing
executable memory areas, including those created by the kernel itself
(for example the kernel usually creates at least one executable
memory area for the ELF
<I>.text</I>

section).
<DT><DD>
The second limitation is that such transitions can be done only once
in a process life time.
Any further attempts will be rejected.
This should help system administrators monitor unusual
symbolic-link transitions over all processes running on a system.
