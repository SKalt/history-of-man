<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B>pread</B>()

reads up to
<I>count</I>

bytes from file descriptor
<I>fd</I>

at offset
<I>offset</I>

(from the start of the file) into the buffer starting at
<I>buf</I>.

The file offset is not changed.
<P>

<B>pwrite</B>()

writes up to
<I>count</I>

bytes from the buffer starting at
<I>buf</I>

to the file descriptor
<I>fd</I>

at offset
<I>offset</I>.

The file offset is not changed.
<P>

The file referenced by
<I>fd</I>

must be capable of seeking.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

On success, the number of bytes read or written is returned (zero
indicates that nothing was written, in the case of
<B>pwrite</B>(),

or
end of file, in the case of
<B>pread</B>()),

or -1 on error, in which case
<I>errno</I>

is set to indicate the error.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

<B>pread</B>()

can fail and set
<I>errno</I>

to any error specified for
<B><A HREF="../man2/read.2.html">read</A></B>(2)

or
<B><A HREF="../man2/lseek.2.html">lseek</A></B>(2).

<B>pwrite</B>()

can fail and set
<I>errno</I>

to any error specified for
<B><A HREF="../man2/write.2.html">write</A></B>(2)

or
<B><A HREF="../man2/lseek.2.html">lseek</A></B>(2).

<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>VERSIONS</H2>

The
<B>pread</B>()

and
<B>pwrite</B>()

system calls were added to Linux in
version 2.1.60; the entries in the i386 system call table were added
in 2.1.69.
C library support (including emulation using
<B><A HREF="../man2/lseek.2.html">lseek</A></B>(2)

on older kernels without the system calls) was added in glibc 2.1.
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>CONFORMING TO</H2>

POSIX.1-2001.
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NOTES</H2>

The
<B>pread</B>()

and
<B>pwrite</B>()

system calls are especially useful in multithreaded applications.
They allow multiple threads to perform I/O on the same file descriptor
without being affected by changes to the file offset by other threads.
<P>
On Linux, the underlying system calls were renamed
in kernel 2.6:
<B>pread</B>()

became
<B>pread64</B>(),

and
<B>pwrite</B>()

became
<B>pwrite64</B>().

The system call numbers remained the same.
The glibc
<B>pread</B>()

and
<B>pwrite</B>()

wrapper functions transparently deal with the change.
<P>
On some 32-bit architectures,
the calling signature for these system calls differ,
for the reasons described in
<B><A HREF="../man2/syscall.2.html">syscall</A></B>(2).

<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>BUGS</H2>

POSIX requires that opening a file with the
<B>O_APPEND</B>

flag should have no affect on the location at which
<B>pwrite</B>()

writes data.
However, on Linux, if a file is opened with

<B>O_APPEND</B>,

<B>pwrite</B>()

appends data to the end of the file, regardless of the value of
<I>offset</I>.
