<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The
<B>ptrace</B>()

system call provides a means by which one process (the &quot;tracer&quot;)
may observe and control the execution of another process (the &quot;tracee&quot;),
and examine and change the tracee's memory and registers.
It is primarily used to implement breakpoint debugging and system
call tracing.
<P>

A tracee first needs to be attached to the tracer.
Attachment and subsequent commands are per thread:
in a multithreaded process,
every thread can be individually attached to a
(potentially different) tracer,
or left not attached and thus not debugged.
Therefore, &quot;tracee&quot; always means &quot;(one) thread&quot;,
never &quot;a (possibly multithreaded) process&quot;.
Ptrace commands are always sent to
a specific tracee using a call of the form
<P>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ptrace(PTRACE_foo,&nbsp;pid,&nbsp;...)
<P>
where
<I>pid</I>

is the thread ID of the corresponding Linux thread.
<P>

(Note that in this page, a &quot;multithreaded process&quot;
means a thread group consisting of threads created using the
<B><A HREF="../man2/clone.2.html">clone</A></B>(2)

<B>CLONE_THREAD</B>

flag.)
<P>

A process can initiate a trace by calling
<B><A HREF="../man2/fork.2.html">fork</A></B>(2)

and having the resulting child do a
<B>PTRACE_TRACEME</B>,

followed (typically) by an
<B><A HREF="../man2/execve.2.html">execve</A></B>(2).

Alternatively, one process may commence tracing another process using
<B>PTRACE_ATTACH</B>.

<P>

While being traced, the tracee will stop each time a signal is delivered,
even if the signal is being ignored.
(An exception is
<B>SIGKILL</B>,

which has its usual effect.)
The tracer will be notified at its next call to
<B><A HREF="../man2/waitpid.2.html">waitpid</A></B>(2)

(or one of the related &quot;wait&quot; system calls); that call will return a
<I>status</I>

value containing information that indicates
the cause of the stop in the tracee.
While the tracee is stopped,
the tracer can use various ptrace requests to inspect and modify the tracee.
The tracer then causes the tracee to continue,
optionally ignoring the delivered signal
(or even delivering a different signal instead).
<P>

If the
<B>PTRACE_O_TRACEEXEC</B>

option is not in effect, all successful calls to
<B><A HREF="../man2/execve.2.html">execve</A></B>(2)

by the traced process will cause it to be sent a
<B>SIGTRAP</B>

signal,
giving the parent a chance to gain control before the new program
begins execution.
<P>

When the tracer is finished tracing, it can cause the tracee to continue
executing in a normal, untraced mode via
<B>PTRACE_DETACH</B>.

<P>

The value of
<I>request</I>

determines the action to be performed:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>PTRACE_TRACEME</B>

<DD>
Indicate that this process is to be traced by its parent.
A process probably shouldn't make this request if its parent
isn't expecting to trace it.
(<I>pid</I>,

<I>addr</I>,

and
<I>data</I>

are ignored.)
</DL>
<P>

The
<B>PTRACE_TRACEME</B>

request is used only by the tracee;
the remaining requests are used only by the tracer.
In the following requests,
<I>pid</I>

specifies the thread ID of the tracee to be acted on.
For requests other than
<B>PTRACE_ATTACH</B>

and
<B>PTRACE_KILL</B>,

the tracee must be stopped.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>PTRACE_PEEKTEXT</B>, <B>PTRACE_PEEKDATA</B>

<DD>
Read a word at the address
<I>addr</I>

in the tracee's memory, returning the word as the result of the
<B>ptrace</B>()

call.
Linux does not have separate text and data address spaces,
so these two requests are currently equivalent.
(<I>data</I>

is ignored.)
<DT><B>PTRACE_PEEKUSER</B>

<DD>


Read a word at offset
<I>addr</I>

in the tracee's USER area,
which holds the registers and other information about the process
(see
<I>&lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/sys/user.h">sys/user.h</A>&gt;</I>).

The word is returned as the result of the
<B>ptrace</B>()

call.
Typically, the offset must be word-aligned, though this might vary by
architecture.
See NOTES.
(<I>data</I>

is ignored.)
<DT><B>PTRACE_POKETEXT</B>, <B>PTRACE_POKEDATA</B>

<DD>
Copy the word
<I>data</I>

to the address
<I>addr</I>

in the tracee's memory.
As for
<B>PTRACE_PEEKTEXT</B>

and
<B>PTRACE_PEEKDATA</B>,

these two requests are currently equivalent.
<DT><B>PTRACE_POKEUSER</B>

<DD>


Copy the word
<I>data</I>

to offset
<I>addr</I>

in the tracee's USER area.
As for
<B>PTRACE_PEEKUSER</B>,

the offset must typically be word-aligned.
In order to maintain the integrity of the kernel,
some modifications to the USER area are disallowed.


<DT><B>PTRACE_GETREGS</B>, <B>PTRACE_GETFPREGS</B>

<DD>
Copy the tracee's general-purpose or floating-point registers,
respectively, to the address
<I>data</I>

in the tracer.
See
<I>&lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/sys/user.h">sys/user.h</A>&gt;</I>

for information on the format of this data.
(<I>addr</I>

is ignored.)
Note that SPARC systems have the meaning of
<I>data</I>

and
<I>addr</I>

reversed; that is,
<I>data</I>

is ignored and the registers are copied to the address
<I>addr</I>.

<B>PTRACE_GETREGS</B>

and
<B>PTRACE_GETFPREGS</B>

are not present on all architectures.
<DT><B>PTRACE_GETSIGINFO</B> (since Linux 2.3.99-pre6)

<DD>
Retrieve information about the signal that caused the stop.
Copy a
<I>siginfo_t</I>

structure (see
<B><A HREF="../man2/sigaction.2.html">sigaction</A></B>(2))

from the tracee to the address
<I>data</I>

in the tracer.
(<I>addr</I>

is ignored.)
<DT><B>PTRACE_SETREGS</B>, <B>PTRACE_SETFPREGS</B>

<DD>
Copy the tracee's general-purpose or floating-point registers,
respectively, from the address
<I>data</I>

in the tracer.
As for
<B>PTRACE_POKEUSER</B>,

some general-purpose register modifications may be disallowed.


(<I>addr</I>

is ignored.)
Note that SPARC systems have the meaning of
<I>data</I>

and
<I>addr</I>

reversed; that is,
<I>data</I>

is ignored and the registers are copied from the address
<I>addr</I>.

<B>PTRACE_SETREGS</B>

and
<B>PTRACE_SETFPREGS</B>

are not present on all architectures.
<DT><B>PTRACE_SETSIGINFO</B> (since Linux 2.3.99-pre6)

<DD>
Set signal information:
copy a
<I>siginfo_t</I>

structure from the address
<I>data</I>

in the tracer to the tracee.
This will affect only signals that would normally be delivered to
the tracee and were caught by the tracer.
It may be difficult to tell
these normal signals from synthetic signals generated by
<B>ptrace</B>()

itself.
(<I>addr</I>

is ignored.)
<DT><B>PTRACE_SETOPTIONS</B> (since Linux 2.4.6; see BUGS for caveats)

<DD>
Set ptrace options from
<I>data</I>.

(<I>addr</I>

is ignored.)
<I>data</I>

is interpreted as a bit mask of options,
which are specified by the following flags:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>PTRACE_O_EXITKILL</B> (since Linux 3.8)

<DD>

If a tracer sets this flag, a
<B>SIGKILL</B>

signal will be sent to every tracee if the tracer exits.
This option is useful for ptrace jailers that
want to ensure that tracees can never escape the tracer's control.
<P>
<DT><B>PTRACE_O_TRACECLONE</B> (since Linux 2.5.46)

<DD>
Stop the tracee at the next
<B><A HREF="../man2/clone.2.html">clone</A></B>(2)

and automatically start tracing the newly cloned process,
which will start with a
<B>SIGSTOP</B>.

A
<B><A HREF="../man2/waitpid.2.html">waitpid</A></B>(2)

by the tracer will return a
<I>status</I>

value such that
<P>
<PRE>
  status&gt;&gt;8 == (SIGTRAP | (PTRACE_EVENT_CLONE&lt;&lt;8))
</PRE>

<P>
The PID of the new process can be retrieved with
<B>PTRACE_GETEVENTMSG</B>.

<DT><DD>
This option may not catch
<B><A HREF="../man2/clone.2.html">clone</A></B>(2)

calls in all cases.
If the tracee calls
<B><A HREF="../man2/clone.2.html">clone</A></B>(2)

with the
<B>CLONE_VFORK</B>

flag,
<B>PTRACE_EVENT_VFORK</B>

will be delivered instead
if
<B>PTRACE_O_TRACEVFORK</B>

is set; otherwise if the tracee calls
<B><A HREF="../man2/clone.2.html">clone</A></B>(2)

with the exit signal set to
<B>SIGCHLD</B>,

<B>PTRACE_EVENT_FORK</B>

will be delivered if
<B>PTRACE_O_TRACEFORK</B>

is set.
<P>
<DT><B>PTRACE_O_TRACEEXEC</B> (since Linux 2.5.46)

<DD>
Stop the tracee at the next
<B><A HREF="../man2/execve.2.html">execve</A></B>(2).

A
<B><A HREF="../man2/waitpid.2.html">waitpid</A></B>(2)

by the tracer will return a
<I>status</I>

value such that
<P>
<PRE>
  status&gt;&gt;8 == (SIGTRAP | (PTRACE_EVENT_EXEC&lt;&lt;8))
</PRE>

<P>
If the execing thread is not a thread group leader,
the thread ID is reset to thread group leader's ID before this stop.
Since Linux 3.0, the former thread ID can be retrieved with
<B>PTRACE_GETEVENTMSG</B>.

<P>
<DT><B>PTRACE_O_TRACEEXIT</B> (since Linux 2.5.60)

<DD>
Stop the tracee at exit.
A
<B><A HREF="../man2/waitpid.2.html">waitpid</A></B>(2)

by the tracer will return a
<I>status</I>

value such that
<P>
<PRE>
  status&gt;&gt;8 == (SIGTRAP | (PTRACE_EVENT_EXIT&lt;&lt;8))
</PRE>

<P>
The tracee's exit status can be retrieved with
<B>PTRACE_GETEVENTMSG</B>.

<DT><DD>
The tracee is stopped early during process exit,
when registers are still available,
allowing the tracer to see where the exit occurred,
whereas the normal exit notification is done after the process
is finished exiting.
Even though context is available,
the tracer cannot prevent the exit from happening at this point.
<P>
<DT><B>PTRACE_O_TRACEFORK</B> (since Linux 2.5.46)

<DD>
Stop the tracee at the next
<B><A HREF="../man2/fork.2.html">fork</A></B>(2)

and automatically start tracing the newly forked process,
which will start with a
<B>SIGSTOP</B>.

A
<B><A HREF="../man2/waitpid.2.html">waitpid</A></B>(2)

by the tracer will return a
<I>status</I>

value such that
<P>
<PRE>
  status&gt;&gt;8 == (SIGTRAP | (PTRACE_EVENT_FORK&lt;&lt;8))
</PRE>

<P>
The PID of the new process can be retrieved with
<B>PTRACE_GETEVENTMSG</B>.

<P>
<DT><B>PTRACE_O_TRACESYSGOOD</B> (since Linux 2.4.6)

<DD>
When delivering system call traps, set bit 7 in the signal number
(i.e., deliver
<I>SIGTRAP|0x80</I>).

This makes it easy for the tracer to distinguish
normal traps from those caused by a system call.
(<B>PTRACE_O_TRACESYSGOOD</B>

may not work on all architectures.)
<DT><B>PTRACE_O_TRACEVFORK</B> (since Linux 2.5.46)

<DD>
Stop the tracee at the next
<B><A HREF="../man2/vfork.2.html">vfork</A></B>(2)

and automatically start tracing the newly vforked process,
which will start with a
<B>SIGSTOP</B>.

A
<B><A HREF="../man2/waitpid.2.html">waitpid</A></B>(2)

by the tracer will return a
<I>status</I>

value such that
<P>
<PRE>
  status&gt;&gt;8 == (SIGTRAP | (PTRACE_EVENT_VFORK&lt;&lt;8))
</PRE>

<P>
The PID of the new process can be retrieved with
<B>PTRACE_GETEVENTMSG</B>.

<DT><B>PTRACE_O_TRACEVFORKDONE</B> (since Linux 2.5.60)

<DD>
Stop the tracee at the completion of the next
<B><A HREF="../man2/vfork.2.html">vfork</A></B>(2).

A
<B><A HREF="../man2/waitpid.2.html">waitpid</A></B>(2)

by the tracer will return a
<I>status</I>

value such that
<P>
<PRE>
  status&gt;&gt;8 == (SIGTRAP | (PTRACE_EVENT_VFORK_DONE&lt;&lt;8))
</PRE>

<P>
The PID of the new process can (since Linux 2.6.18) be retrieved with
<B>PTRACE_GETEVENTMSG</B>.

<P>
</DL>
</DL>

<P>
<DT><B>PTRACE_GETEVENTMSG</B> (since Linux 2.5.46)

<DD>
Retrieve a message (as an
<I>unsigned long</I>)

about the ptrace event
that just happened, placing it at the address
<I>data</I>

in the tracer.
For
<B>PTRACE_EVENT_EXIT</B>,

this is the tracee's exit status.
For
<B>PTRACE_EVENT_FORK</B>,

<B>PTRACE_EVENT_VFORK</B>,

<B>PTRACE_EVENT_VFORK_DONE</B>,

and
<B>PTRACE_EVENT_CLONE</B>,

this is the PID of the new process.
(<I>addr</I>

is ignored.)
<DT><B>PTRACE_CONT</B>

<DD>
Restart the stopped tracee process.
If
<I>data</I>

is nonzero,
it is interpreted as the number of a signal to be delivered to the tracee;
otherwise, no signal is delivered.
Thus, for example, the tracer can control
whether a signal sent to the tracee is delivered or not.
(<I>addr</I>

is ignored.)
<DT><B>PTRACE_SYSCALL</B>, <B>PTRACE_SINGLESTEP</B>

<DD>
Restart the stopped tracee as for
<B>PTRACE_CONT</B>,

but arrange for the tracee to be stopped at
the next entry to or exit from a system call,
or after execution of a single instruction, respectively.
(The tracee will also, as usual, be stopped upon receipt of a signal.)
From the tracer's perspective, the tracee will appear to have been
stopped by receipt of a
<B>SIGTRAP</B>.

So, for
<B>PTRACE_SYSCALL</B>,

for example, the idea is to inspect
the arguments to the system call at the first stop,
then do another
<B>PTRACE_SYSCALL</B>

and inspect the return value of the system call at the second stop.
The
<I>data</I>

argument is treated as for
<B>PTRACE_CONT</B>.

(<I>addr</I>

is ignored.)
<DT><B>PTRACE_SYSEMU</B>, <B>PTRACE_SYSEMU_SINGLESTEP</B> (since Linux 2.6.14)

<DD>
For
<B>PTRACE_SYSEMU</B>,

continue and stop on entry to the next system call,
which will not be executed.
For
<B>PTRACE_SYSEMU_SINGLESTEP</B>,

do the same but also singlestep if not a system call.
This call is used by programs like
User Mode Linux that want to emulate all the tracee's system calls.
The
<I>data</I>

argument is treated as for
<B>PTRACE_CONT</B>.

The
<I>addr</I>

argument is ignored.
These requests are currently

supported only on x86.
<DT><B>PTRACE_KILL</B>

<DD>
Send the tracee a
<B>SIGKILL</B>

to terminate it.
(<I>addr</I>

and
<I>data</I>

are ignored.)
<DT><DD>
<I>This operation is deprecated; do not use it!</I>

Instead, send a
<B>SIGKILL</B>

directly using
<B><A HREF="../man2/kill.2.html">kill</A></B>(2)

or
<B><A HREF="../man2/tgkill.2.html">tgkill</A></B>(2).

The problem with
<B>PTRACE_KILL</B>

is that it requires the tracee to be in signal-delivery-stop,
otherwise it may not work
(i.e., may complete successfully but won't kill the tracee).
By contrast, sending a
<B>SIGKILL</B>

directly has no such limitation.



<DT><B>PTRACE_ATTACH</B>

<DD>
Attach to the process specified in
<I>pid</I>,

making it a tracee of the calling process.












The tracee is sent a
<B>SIGSTOP</B>,

but will not necessarily have stopped
by the completion of this call; use
<B><A HREF="../man2/waitpid.2.html">waitpid</A></B>(2)

to wait for the tracee to stop.
See the &quot;Attaching and detaching&quot; subsection for additional information.
(<I>addr</I>

and
<I>data</I>

are ignored.)
<DT><B>PTRACE_DETACH</B>

<DD>
Restart the stopped tracee as for
<B>PTRACE_CONT</B>,

but first detach from it.
Under Linux, a tracee can be detached in this way regardless
of which method was used to initiate tracing.
(<I>addr</I>

is ignored.)
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Death under ptrace</H3>

When a (possibly multithreaded) process receives a killing signal
(one whose disposition is set to
<B>SIG_DFL</B>

and whose default action is to kill the process),
all threads exit.
Tracees report their death to their tracer(s).
Notification of this event is delivered via
<B><A HREF="../man2/waitpid.2.html">waitpid</A></B>(2).

<P>

Note that the killing signal will first cause signal-delivery-stop
(on one tracee only),
and only after it is injected by the tracer
(or after it was dispatched to a thread which isn't traced),
will death from the signal happen on
<I>all</I>

tracees within a multithreaded process.
(The term &quot;signal-delivery-stop&quot; is explained below.)
<P>

<B>SIGKILL</B>

does not generate signal-delivery-stop and
therefore the tracer can't suppress it.
<B>SIGKILL</B>

kills even within system calls
(syscall-exit-stop is not generated prior to death by
<B>SIGKILL</B>).

The net effect is that
<B>SIGKILL</B>

always kills the process (all its threads),
even if some threads of the process are ptraced.
<P>

When the tracee calls
<B><A HREF="../man2/_exit.2.html">_exit</A></B>(2),

it reports its death to its tracer.
Other threads are not affected.
<P>

When any thread executes
<B><A HREF="../man2/exit_group.2.html">exit_group</A></B>(2),

every tracee in its thread group reports its death to its tracer.
<P>

If the
<B>PTRACE_O_TRACEEXIT</B>

option is on,
<B>PTRACE_EVENT_EXIT</B>

will happen before actual death.
This applies to exits via
<B><A HREF="../man2/exit.2.html">exit</A></B>(2),

<B><A HREF="../man2/exit_group.2.html">exit_group</A></B>(2),

and signal deaths (except
<B>SIGKILL</B>),

and when threads are torn down on
<B><A HREF="../man2/execve.2.html">execve</A></B>(2)

in a multithreaded process.
<P>

The tracer cannot assume that the ptrace-stopped tracee exists.
There are many scenarios when the tracee may die while stopped (such as
<B>SIGKILL</B>).

Therefore, the tracer must be prepared to handle an
<B>ESRCH</B>

error on any ptrace operation.
Unfortunately, the same error is returned if the tracee
exists but is not ptrace-stopped
(for commands which require a stopped tracee),
or if it is not traced by the process which issued the ptrace call.
The tracer needs to keep track of the stopped/running state of the tracee,
and interpret
<B>ESRCH</B>

as &quot;tracee died unexpectedly&quot; only if it knows that the tracee has
been observed to enter ptrace-stop.
Note that there is no guarantee that
<I>waitpid(WNOHANG)</I>

will reliably report the tracee's death status if a
ptrace operation returned
<B>ESRCH</B>.

<I>waitpid(WNOHANG)</I>

may return 0 instead.
In other words, the tracee may be &quot;not yet fully dead&quot;,
but already refusing ptrace requests.
<P>

The tracer can't assume that the tracee
<I>always</I>

ends its life by reporting
<I>WIFEXITED(status)</I>

or
<I>WIFSIGNALED(status)</I>;

there are cases where this does not occur.
For example, if a thread other than thread group leader does an
<B><A HREF="../man2/execve.2.html">execve</A></B>(2),

it disappears;
its PID will never be seen again,
and any subsequent ptrace stops will be reported under
the thread group leader's PID.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Stopped states</H3>

A tracee can be in two states: running or stopped.
<P>

There are many kinds of states when the tracee is stopped, and in ptrace
discussions they are often conflated.
Therefore, it is important to use precise terms.
<P>

In this manual page, any stopped state in which the tracee is ready
to accept ptrace commands from the tracer is called
<I>ptrace-stop</I>.

Ptrace-stops can
be further subdivided into
<I>signal-delivery-stop</I>,

<I>group-stop</I>,

<I>syscall-stop</I>,

and so on.
These stopped states are described in detail below.
<P>

When the running tracee enters ptrace-stop, it notifies its tracer using
<B><A HREF="../man2/waitpid.2.html">waitpid</A></B>(2)

(or one of the other &quot;wait&quot; system calls).
Most of this manual page assumes that the tracer waits with:
<P>

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pid&nbsp;=&nbsp;waitpid(pid_or_minus_1,&nbsp;&amp;status,&nbsp;__WALL);
<P>

Ptrace-stopped tracees are reported as returns with
<I>pid</I>

greater than 0 and
<I>WIFSTOPPED(status)</I>

true.






<P>

The
<B>__WALL</B>

flag does not include the
<B>WSTOPPED</B>

and
<B>WEXITED</B>

flags, but implies their functionality.
<P>

Setting the
<B>WCONTINUED</B>

flag when calling
<B><A HREF="../man2/waitpid.2.html">waitpid</A></B>(2)

is not recommended: the &quot;continued&quot; state is per-process and
consuming it can confuse the real parent of the tracee.
<P>

Use of the
<B>WNOHANG</B>

flag may cause
<B><A HREF="../man2/waitpid.2.html">waitpid</A></B>(2)

to return 0 (&quot;no wait results available yet&quot;)
even if the tracer knows there should be a notification.
Example:
<PRE>

    errno = 0;
    ptrace(PTRACE_CONT, pid, 0L, 0L);
    if (errno == ESRCH) {
        /* tracee is dead */
        r = waitpid(tracee, &amp;status, __WALL | WNOHANG);
        /* r can still be 0 here! */
    }
</PRE>




<P>

The following kinds of ptrace-stops exist: signal-delivery-stops,
group-stops,
<B>PTRACE_EVENT</B>

stops, syscall-stops.
They all are reported by
<B><A HREF="../man2/waitpid.2.html">waitpid</A></B>(2)

with
<I>WIFSTOPPED(status)</I>

true.
They may be differentiated by examining the value
<I>status&gt;&gt;8</I>,

and if there is ambiguity in that value, by querying
<B>PTRACE_GETSIGINFO</B>.

(Note: the
<I>WSTOPSIG(status)</I>

macro can't be used to perform this examination,
because it returns the value
<I>(status&gt;&gt;8)&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;0xff</I>.)

<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Signal-delivery-stop</H3>

When a (possibly multithreaded) process receives any signal except
<B>SIGKILL</B>,

the kernel selects an arbitrary thread which handles the signal.
(If the signal is generated with
<B><A HREF="../man2/tgkill.2.html">tgkill</A></B>(2),

the target thread can be explicitly selected by the caller.)
If the selected thread is traced, it enters signal-delivery-stop.
At this point, the signal is not yet delivered to the process,
and can be suppressed by the tracer.
If the tracer doesn't suppress the signal,
it passes the signal to the tracee in the next ptrace restart request.
This second step of signal delivery is called
<I>signal injection</I>

in this manual page.
Note that if the signal is blocked,
signal-delivery-stop doesn't happen until the signal is unblocked,
with the usual exception that
<B>SIGSTOP</B>

can't be blocked.
<P>

Signal-delivery-stop is observed by the tracer as
<B><A HREF="../man2/waitpid.2.html">waitpid</A></B>(2)

returning with
<I>WIFSTOPPED(status)</I>

true, with the signal returned by
<I>WSTOPSIG(status)</I>.

If the signal is
<B>SIGTRAP</B>,

this may be a different kind of ptrace-stop;
see the &quot;Syscall-stops&quot; and &quot;execve&quot; sections below for details.
If
<I>WSTOPSIG(status)</I>

returns a stopping signal, this may be a group-stop; see below.
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Signal injection and suppression</H3>

After signal-delivery-stop is observed by the tracer,
the tracer should restart the tracee with the call
<P>

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ptrace(PTRACE_restart,&nbsp;pid,&nbsp;0,&nbsp;sig)
<P>

where
<B>PTRACE_restart</B>

is one of the restarting ptrace requests.
If
<I>sig</I>

is 0, then a signal is not delivered.
Otherwise, the signal
<I>sig</I>

is delivered.
This operation is called
<I>signal injection</I>

in this manual page, to distinguish it from signal-delivery-stop.
<P>

The
<I>sig</I>

value may be different from the
<I>WSTOPSIG(status)</I>

value: the tracer can cause a different signal to be injected.
<P>

Note that a suppressed signal still causes system calls to return
prematurely.
In this case system calls will be restarted: the tracer will
observe the tracee to reexecute the interrupted system call (or
<B><A HREF="../man2/restart_syscall.2.html">restart_syscall</A></B>(2)

system call for a few syscalls which use a different mechanism
for restarting) if the tracer uses
<B>PTRACE_SYSCALL</B>.

Even system calls (such as
<B><A HREF="../man2/poll.2.html">poll</A></B>(2))

which are not restartable after signal are restarted after
signal is suppressed;
however, kernel bugs exist which cause some syscalls to fail with
<B>EINTR</B>

even though no observable signal is injected to the tracee.
<P>

Restarting ptrace commands issued in ptrace-stops other than
signal-delivery-stop are not guaranteed to inject a signal, even if
<I>sig</I>

is nonzero.
No error is reported; a nonzero
<I>sig</I>

may simply be ignored.
Ptrace users should not try to &quot;create a new signal&quot; this way: use
<B><A HREF="../man2/tgkill.2.html">tgkill</A></B>(2)

instead.
<P>

The fact that signal injection requests may be ignored
when restarting the tracee after
ptrace stops that are not signal-delivery-stops
is a cause of confusion among ptrace users.
One typical scenario is that the tracer observes group-stop,
mistakes it for signal-delivery-stop, restarts the tracee with
<P>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ptrace(PTRACE_rest,&nbsp;pid,&nbsp;0,&nbsp;stopsig)
<P>
with the intention of injecting
<I>stopsig</I>,

but
<I>stopsig</I>

gets ignored and the tracee continues to run.
<P>

The
<B>SIGCONT</B>

signal has a side effect of waking up (all threads of)
a group-stopped process.
This side effect happens before signal-delivery-stop.
The tracer can't suppress this side effect (it can
only suppress signal injection, which only causes the
<B>SIGCONT</B>

handler to not be executed in the tracee, if such a handler is installed).
In fact, waking up from group-stop may be followed by
signal-delivery-stop for signal(s)
<I>other than</I>

<B>SIGCONT</B>,

if they were pending when
<B>SIGCONT</B>

was delivered.
In other words,
<B>SIGCONT</B>

may be not the first signal observed by the tracee after it was sent.
<P>

Stopping signals cause (all threads of) a process to enter group-stop.
This side effect happens after signal injection, and therefore can be
suppressed by the tracer.
<P>

In Linux 2.4 and earlier, the
<B>SIGSTOP</B>

signal can't be injected.






<P>

<B>PTRACE_GETSIGINFO</B>

can be used to retrieve a
<I>siginfo_t</I>

structure which corresponds to the delivered signal.
<B>PTRACE_SETSIGINFO</B>

may be used to modify it.
If
<B>PTRACE_SETSIGINFO</B>

has been used to alter
<I>siginfo_t</I>,

the
<I>si_signo</I>

field and the
<I>sig</I>

parameter in the restarting command must match,
otherwise the result is undefined.
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Group-stop</H3>

When a (possibly multithreaded) process receives a stopping signal,
all threads stop.
If some threads are traced, they enter a group-stop.
Note that the stopping signal will first cause signal-delivery-stop
(on one tracee only), and only after it is injected by the tracer
(or after it was dispatched to a thread which isn't traced),
will group-stop be initiated on
<I>all</I>

tracees within the multithreaded process.
As usual, every tracee reports its group-stop separately
to the corresponding tracer.
<P>

Group-stop is observed by the tracer as
<B><A HREF="../man2/waitpid.2.html">waitpid</A></B>(2)

returning with
<I>WIFSTOPPED(status)</I>

true, with the stopping signal available via
<I>WSTOPSIG(status)</I>.

The same result is returned by some other classes of ptrace-stops,
therefore the recommended practice is to perform the call
<P>

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ptrace(PTRACE_GETSIGINFO,&nbsp;pid,&nbsp;0,&nbsp;&amp;siginfo)
<P>

The call can be avoided if the signal is not
<B>SIGSTOP</B>,

<B>SIGTSTP</B>,

<B>SIGTTIN</B>,

or
<B>SIGTTOU</B>;

only these four signals are stopping signals.
If the tracer sees something else, it can't be a group-stop.
Otherwise, the tracer needs to call
<B>PTRACE_GETSIGINFO</B>.

If
<B>PTRACE_GETSIGINFO</B>

fails with
<B>EINVAL</B>,

then it is definitely a group-stop.
(Other failure codes are possible, such as
<B>ESRCH</B>

(&quot;no such process&quot;) if a
<B>SIGKILL</B>

killed the tracee.)
<P>

As of kernel 2.6.38,
after the tracer sees the tracee ptrace-stop and until it
restarts or kills it, the tracee will not run,
and will not send notifications (except
<B>SIGKILL</B>

death) to the tracer, even if the tracer enters into another
<B><A HREF="../man2/waitpid.2.html">waitpid</A></B>(2)

call.
<P>

The kernel behavior described in the previous paragraph
causes a problem with transparent handling of stopping signals.
If the tracer restarts the tracee after group-stop,
the stopping signal
is effectively ignored---the tracee doesn't remain stopped, it runs.
If the tracer doesn't restart the tracee before entering into the next
<B><A HREF="../man2/waitpid.2.html">waitpid</A></B>(2),

future
<B>SIGCONT</B>

signals will not be reported to the tracer;
this would cause the
<B>SIGCONT</B>

signals to have no effect on the tracee.
<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>PTRACE_EVENT stops</H3>

If the tracer sets
<B>PTRACE_O_TRACE_*</B>

options, the tracee will enter ptrace-stops called
<B>PTRACE_EVENT</B>

stops.
<P>

<B>PTRACE_EVENT</B>

stops are observed by the tracer as
<B><A HREF="../man2/waitpid.2.html">waitpid</A></B>(2)

returning with
<I>WIFSTOPPED(status)</I>,

and
<I>WSTOPSIG(status)</I>

returns
<B>SIGTRAP</B>.

An additional bit is set in the higher byte of the status word:
the value
<I>status&gt;&gt;8</I>

will be
<P>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(SIGTRAP&nbsp;|&nbsp;PTRACE_EVENT_foo&nbsp;&lt;&lt;&nbsp;8).

When the tracee is continued after this stop, it will wait for child to

For all four stops described above,

in a multithreaded process.
<B>PTRACE_GETEVENTMSG</B>

returns the exit status.
Registers can be examined
(unlike when &quot;real&quot; exit happens).
The tracee is still alive; it needs to be

or

to finish exiting.
</DL>

<B>PTRACE_GETSIGINFO</B>

<A NAME="lbAK">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Syscall-stops</H3>

If the tracee was restarted by
<B>PTRACE_SYSCALL</B>,

the tracee enters
syscall-enter-stop just prior to entering any system call.
If the tracer restarts the tracee with
<B>PTRACE_SYSCALL</B>,

the tracee enters syscall-exit-stop when the system call is finished,
or if it is interrupted by a signal.
(That is, signal-delivery-stop never happens between syscall-enter-stop
and syscall-exit-stop; it happens
<I>after</I>

syscall-exit-stop.)
<P>

Other possibilities are that the tracee may stop in a
<B>PTRACE_EVENT</B>

stop, exit (if it entered
<B><A HREF="../man2/_exit.2.html">_exit</A></B>(2)

or
<B><A HREF="../man2/exit_group.2.html">exit_group</A></B>(2)),

be killed by
<B>SIGKILL</B>,

or die silently (if it is a thread group leader, the
<B><A HREF="../man2/execve.2.html">execve</A></B>(2)

happened in another thread,
and that thread is not traced by the same tracer;
this situation is discussed later).
<P>

Syscall-enter-stop and syscall-exit-stop are observed by the tracer as
<B><A HREF="../man2/waitpid.2.html">waitpid</A></B>(2)

returning with
<I>WIFSTOPPED(status)</I>

true, and
<I>WSTOPSIG(status)</I>

giving
<B>SIGTRAP</B>.

If the
<B>PTRACE_O_TRACESYSGOOD</B>

option was set by the tracer, then
<I>WSTOPSIG(status)</I>

will give the value
<I>(SIGTRAP&nbsp;|&nbsp;0x80)</I>.

<P>

Syscall-stops can be distinguished from signal-delivery-stop with
<B>SIGTRAP</B>

by querying
<B>PTRACE_GETSIGINFO</B>

for the following cases:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><I>si_code</I> &lt;= 0

<DD>
<B>SIGTRAP</B>

was delivered as a result of a user-space action,
for example, a system call
(<B><A HREF="../man2/tgkill.2.html">tgkill</A></B>(2),

<B><A HREF="../man2/kill.2.html">kill</A></B>(2),

<B><A HREF="../man3/sigqueue.3.html">sigqueue</A></B>(3),

etc.),
expiration of a POSIX timer,
change of state on a POSIX message queue,
or completion of an asynchronous I/O request.
<DT><I>si_code</I> == SI_KERNEL (0x80)

<DD>
<B>SIGTRAP</B>

was sent by the kernel.
<DT><I>si_code</I> == SIGTRAP or <I>si_code</I> == (SIGTRAP|0x80)

<DD>
This is a syscall-stop.
</DL>
<P>

However, syscall-stops happen very often (twice per system call),
and performing
<B>PTRACE_GETSIGINFO</B>

for every syscall-stop may be somewhat expensive.
<P>

Some architectures allow the cases to be distinguished
by examining registers.
For example, on x86,
<I>rax</I>

==
-<B>ENOSYS</B>

in syscall-enter-stop.
Since
<B>SIGTRAP</B>

(like any other signal) always happens
<I>after</I>

syscall-exit-stop,
and at this point
<I>rax</I>

almost never contains
-<B>ENOSYS</B>,

the
<B>SIGTRAP</B>

looks like &quot;syscall-stop which is not syscall-enter-stop&quot;;
in other words, it looks like a
&quot;stray syscall-exit-stop&quot; and can be detected this way.
But such detection is fragile and is best avoided.
<P>

Using the
<B>PTRACE_O_TRACESYSGOOD</B>

option is the recommended method to distinguish syscall-stops
from other kinds of ptrace-stops,
since it is reliable and does not incur a performance penalty.
<P>

Syscall-enter-stop and syscall-exit-stop are
indistinguishable from each other by the tracer.
The tracer needs to keep track of the sequence of
ptrace-stops in order to not misinterpret syscall-enter-stop as
syscall-exit-stop or vice versa.
The rule is that syscall-enter-stop is
always followed by syscall-exit-stop,
<B>PTRACE_EVENT</B>

stop or the tracee's death;
no other kinds of ptrace-stop can occur in between.
<P>

If after syscall-enter-stop,
the tracer uses a restarting command other than
<B>PTRACE_SYSCALL</B>,

syscall-exit-stop is not generated.
<P>

<B>PTRACE_GETSIGINFO</B>

on syscall-stops returns
<B>SIGTRAP</B>

in
<I>si_signo</I>,

with
<I>si_code</I>

set to
<B>SIGTRAP</B>

or
<I>(SIGTRAP|0x80)</I>.

<A NAME="lbAL">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>PTRACE_SINGLESTEP, PTRACE_SYSEMU, PTRACE_SYSEMU_SINGLESTEP stops</H3>

[Details of these kinds of stops are yet to be documented.]




<A NAME="lbAM">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Informational and restarting ptrace commands</H3>

Most ptrace commands (all except
<B>PTRACE_ATTACH</B>,

<B>PTRACE_TRACEME</B>,

and
<B>PTRACE_KILL</B>)

require the tracee to be in a ptrace-stop, otherwise they fail with
<B>ESRCH</B>.

<P>

When the tracee is in ptrace-stop,
the tracer can read and write data to
the tracee using informational commands.
These commands leave the tracee in ptrace-stopped state:
<P>

<PRE>
    ptrace(PTRACE_PEEKTEXT/PEEKDATA/PEEKUSER, pid, addr, 0);
    ptrace(PTRACE_POKETEXT/POKEDATA/POKEUSER, pid, addr, long_val);
    ptrace(PTRACE_GETREGS/GETFPREGS, pid, 0, &amp;struct);
    ptrace(PTRACE_SETREGS/SETFPREGS, pid, 0, &amp;struct);
    ptrace(PTRACE_GETSIGINFO, pid, 0, &amp;siginfo);
    ptrace(PTRACE_SETSIGINFO, pid, 0, &amp;siginfo);
    ptrace(PTRACE_GETEVENTMSG, pid, 0, &amp;long_var);
    ptrace(PTRACE_SETOPTIONS, pid, 0, PTRACE_O_flags);
</PRE>

<P>

Note that some errors are not reported.
For example, setting signal information
(<I>siginfo</I>)

may have no effect in some ptrace-stops, yet the call may succeed
(return 0 and not set
<I>errno</I>);

querying
<B>PTRACE_GETEVENTMSG</B>

may succeed and return some random value if current ptrace-stop
is not documented as returning a meaningful event message.
<P>

The call
<P>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ptrace(PTRACE_SETOPTIONS,&nbsp;pid,&nbsp;0,&nbsp;PTRACE_O_flags);
<P>
affects one tracee.
The tracee's current flags are replaced.
Flags are inherited by new tracees created and &quot;auto-attached&quot; via active
<B>PTRACE_O_TRACEFORK</B>,

<B>PTRACE_O_TRACEVFORK</B>,

or
<B>PTRACE_O_TRACECLONE</B>

options.
<P>

Another group of commands makes the ptrace-stopped tracee run.
They have the form:
<P>

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ptrace(cmd,&nbsp;pid,&nbsp;0,&nbsp;sig);
<P>

where
<I>cmd</I>

is
<B>PTRACE_CONT</B>,

<B>PTRACE_DETACH</B>,

<B>PTRACE_SYSCALL</B>,

<B>PTRACE_SINGLESTEP</B>,

<B>PTRACE_SYSEMU</B>,

or
<B>PTRACE_SYSEMU_SINGLESTEP</B>.

If the tracee is in signal-delivery-stop,
<I>sig</I>

is the signal to be injected (if it is nonzero).
Otherwise,
<I>sig</I>

may be ignored.
(When restarting a tracee from a ptrace-stop other than signal-delivery-stop,
recommended practice is to always pass 0 in
<I>sig</I>.)

<A NAME="lbAN">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Attaching and detaching</H3>

A thread can be attached to the tracer using the call
<P>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ptrace(PTRACE_ATTACH,&nbsp;pid,&nbsp;0,&nbsp;0);
<P>
This also sends
<B>SIGSTOP</B>

to this thread.
If the tracer wants this
<B>SIGSTOP</B>

to have no effect, it needs to suppress it.
Note that if other signals are concurrently sent to
this thread during attach,
the tracer may see the tracee enter signal-delivery-stop
with other signal(s) first!
The usual practice is to reinject these signals until
<B>SIGSTOP</B>

is seen, then suppress
<B>SIGSTOP</B>

injection.
The design bug here is that a ptrace attach and a concurrently delivered
<B>SIGSTOP</B>

may race and the concurrent
<B>SIGSTOP</B>

may be lost.



<P>

Since attaching sends
<B>SIGSTOP</B>

and the tracer usually suppresses it, this may cause a stray
<B>EINTR</B>

return from the currently executing system call in the tracee,
as described in the &quot;Signal injection and suppression&quot; section.
<P>

The request
<P>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ptrace(PTRACE_TRACEME,&nbsp;0,&nbsp;0,&nbsp;0);
<P>
turns the calling thread into a tracee.
The thread continues to run (doesn't enter ptrace-stop).
A common practice is to follow the
<B>PTRACE_TRACEME</B>

with
<P>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;raise(SIGSTOP);
<P>
and allow the parent (which is our tracer now) to observe our
signal-delivery-stop.
<P>

If the
<B>PTRACE_O_TRACEFORK</B>,

<B>PTRACE_O_TRACEVFORK</B>,

or
<B>PTRACE_O_TRACECLONE</B>

options are in effect, then children created by, respectively,
<B><A HREF="../man2/vfork.2.html">vfork</A></B>(2)

or
<B><A HREF="../man2/clone.2.html">clone</A></B>(2)

with the
<B>CLONE_VFORK</B>

flag,
<B><A HREF="../man2/fork.2.html">fork</A></B>(2)

or
<B><A HREF="../man2/clone.2.html">clone</A></B>(2)

with the exit signal set to
<B>SIGCHLD</B>,

and other kinds of
<B><A HREF="../man2/clone.2.html">clone</A></B>(2),

are automatically attached to the same tracer which traced their parent.
<B>SIGSTOP</B>

is delivered to the children, causing them to enter
signal-delivery-stop after they exit the system call which created them.
<P>

Detaching of the tracee is performed by:
<P>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ptrace(PTRACE_DETACH,&nbsp;pid,&nbsp;0,&nbsp;sig);
<P>
<B>PTRACE_DETACH</B>

is a restarting operation;
therefore it requires the tracee to be in ptrace-stop.
If the tracee is in signal-delivery-stop, a signal can be injected.
Otherwise, the
<I>sig</I>

parameter may be silently ignored.
<P>

If the tracee is running when the tracer wants to detach it,
the usual solution is to send
<B>SIGSTOP</B>

(using
<B><A HREF="../man2/tgkill.2.html">tgkill</A></B>(2),

to make sure it goes to the correct thread),
wait for the tracee to stop in signal-delivery-stop for
<B>SIGSTOP</B>

and then detach it (suppressing
<B>SIGSTOP</B>

injection).
A design bug is that this can race with concurrent
<B>SIGSTOP</B>s.

Another complication is that the tracee may enter other ptrace-stops
and needs to be restarted and waited for again, until
<B>SIGSTOP</B>

is seen.
Yet another complication is to be sure that
the tracee is not already ptrace-stopped,
because no signal delivery happens while it is---not even
<B>SIGSTOP</B>.



<P>

If the tracer dies, all tracees are automatically detached and restarted,
unless they were in group-stop.
Handling of restart from group-stop is currently buggy,
but the &quot;as planned&quot; behavior is to leave tracee stopped and waiting for
<B>SIGCONT</B>.

If the tracee is restarted from signal-delivery-stop,
the pending signal is injected.
<A NAME="lbAO">&nbsp;</A>
<H3><A HREF="../man2/execve.2.html">execve</A>(2) under ptrace</H3>






When one thread in a multithreaded process calls
<B><A HREF="../man2/execve.2.html">execve</A></B>(2),

the kernel destroys all other threads in the process,

and resets the thread ID of the execing thread to the
thread group ID (process ID).
(Or, to put things another way, when a multithreaded process does an
<B><A HREF="../man2/execve.2.html">execve</A></B>(2),

at completion of the call, it appears as though the
<B><A HREF="../man2/execve.2.html">execve</A></B>(2)

occurred in the thread group leader, regardless of which thread did the
<B><A HREF="../man2/execve.2.html">execve</A></B>(2).)

This resetting of the thread ID looks very confusing to tracers:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
All other threads stop in
<B>PTRACE_EVENT_EXIT</B>

stop, if the
<B>PTRACE_O_TRACEEXIT</B>

option was turned on.
Then all other threads except the thread group leader report
death as if they exited via
<B><A HREF="../man2/_exit.2.html">_exit</A></B>(2)

with exit code 0.
<DT>*<DD>
The execing tracee changes its thread ID while it is in the
<B><A HREF="../man2/execve.2.html">execve</A></B>(2).

(Remember, under ptrace, the &quot;pid&quot; returned from
<B><A HREF="../man2/waitpid.2.html">waitpid</A></B>(2),

or fed into ptrace calls, is the tracee's thread ID.)
That is, the tracee's thread ID is reset to be the same as its process ID,
which is the same as the thread group leader's thread ID.
<DT>*<DD>
Then a
<B>PTRACE_EVENT_EXEC</B>

stop happens, if the
<B>PTRACE_O_TRACEEXEC</B>

option was turned on.
<DT>*<DD>
If the thread group leader has reported its
<B>PTRACE_EVENT_EXIT</B>

stop by this time,
it appears to the tracer that
the dead thread leader &quot;reappears from nowhere&quot;.
(Note: the thread group leader does not report death via
<I>WIFEXITED(status)</I>

until there is at least one other live thread.
This eliminates the possibility that the tracer will see
it dying and then reappearing.)
If the thread group leader was still alive,
for the tracer this may look as if thread group leader
returns from a different system call than it entered,
or even &quot;returned from a system call even though
it was not in any system call&quot;.
If the thread group leader was not traced
(or was traced by a different tracer), then during
<B><A HREF="../man2/execve.2.html">execve</A></B>(2)

it will appear as if it has become a tracee of
the tracer of the execing tracee.
</DL>
<P>

All of the above effects are the artifacts of
the thread ID change in the tracee.
<P>

The
<B>PTRACE_O_TRACEEXEC</B>

option is the recommended tool for dealing with this situation.
First, it enables
<B>PTRACE_EVENT_EXEC</B>

stop,
which occurs before
<B><A HREF="../man2/execve.2.html">execve</A></B>(2)

returns.
In this stop, the tracer can use
<B>PTRACE_GETEVENTMSG</B>

to retrieve the tracee's former thread ID.
(This feature was introduced in Linux 3.0).
Second, the
<B>PTRACE_O_TRACEEXEC</B>

option disables legacy
<B>SIGTRAP</B>

generation on
<B><A HREF="../man2/execve.2.html">execve</A></B>(2).

<P>

When the tracer receives
<B>PTRACE_EVENT_EXEC</B>

stop notification,
it is guaranteed that except this tracee and the thread group leader,
no other threads from the process are alive.
<P>

On receiving the
<B>PTRACE_EVENT_EXEC</B>

stop notification,
the tracer should clean up all its internal
data structures describing the threads of this process,
and retain only one data structure---one which
describes the single still running tracee, with
<P>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thread&nbsp;ID&nbsp;==&nbsp;thread&nbsp;group&nbsp;ID&nbsp;==&nbsp;process&nbsp;ID.
<P>

Example: two threads call
<B><A HREF="../man2/execve.2.html">execve</A></B>(2)

at the same time:
<P>

<PRE>
*** we get syscall-enter-stop in thread 1: **
PID1 execve(&quot;/bin/foo&quot;, &quot;foo&quot; &lt;unfinished ...&gt;
*** we issue PTRACE_SYSCALL for thread 1 **
*** we get syscall-enter-stop in thread 2: **
PID2 execve(&quot;/bin/bar&quot;, &quot;bar&quot; &lt;unfinished ...&gt;
*** we issue PTRACE_SYSCALL for thread 2 **
*** we get PTRACE_EVENT_EXEC for PID0, we issue PTRACE_SYSCALL **
*** we get syscall-exit-stop for PID0: **
PID0 &lt;... execve resumed&gt; )             = 0
</PRE>

<P>

If the
<B>PTRACE_O_TRACEEXEC</B>

option is
<I>not</I>

in effect for the execing tracee, the kernel delivers an extra
<B>SIGTRAP</B>

to the tracee after
<B><A HREF="../man2/execve.2.html">execve</A></B>(2)

returns.
This is an ordinary signal (similar to one which can be
generated by
<I>kill -TRAP</I>),

not a special kind of ptrace-stop.
Employing
<B>PTRACE_GETSIGINFO</B>

for this signal returns
<I>si_code</I>

set to 0
(<I>SI_USER</I>).

This signal may be blocked by signal mask,
and thus may be delivered (much) later.
<P>

Usually, the tracer (for example,
<B><A HREF="../man1/strace.1.html">strace</A></B>(1))

would not want to show this extra post-execve
<B>SIGTRAP</B>

signal to the user, and would suppress its delivery to the tracee (if
<B>SIGTRAP</B>

is set to
<B>SIG_DFL</B>,

it is a killing signal).
However, determining
<I>which</I>

<B>SIGTRAP</B>

to suppress is not easy.
Setting the
<B>PTRACE_O_TRACEEXEC</B>

option and thus suppressing this extra
<B>SIGTRAP</B>

is the recommended approach.
<A NAME="lbAP">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Real parent</H3>

The ptrace API (ab)uses the standard UNIX parent/child signaling over
<B><A HREF="../man2/waitpid.2.html">waitpid</A></B>(2).

This used to cause the real parent of the process to stop receiving
several kinds of
<B><A HREF="../man2/waitpid.2.html">waitpid</A></B>(2)

notifications when the child process is traced by some other process.
<P>

Many of these bugs have been fixed, but as of Linux 2.6.38 several still
exist; see BUGS below.
<P>

As of Linux 2.6.38, the following is believed to work correctly:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
exit/death by signal is reported first to the tracer, then,
when the tracer consumes the
<B><A HREF="../man2/waitpid.2.html">waitpid</A></B>(2)

result, to the real parent (to the real parent only when the
whole multithreaded process exits).
If the tracer and the real parent are the same process,
the report is sent only once.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAQ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

On success,
<B>PTRACE_PEEK*</B>

requests return the requested data,
while other requests return zero.
On error, all requests return -1, and
<I>errno</I>

is set appropriately.
Since the value returned by a successful
<B>PTRACE_PEEK*</B>

request may be -1, the caller must clear
<I>errno</I>

before the call, and then check it afterward
to determine whether or not an error occurred.
<A NAME="lbAR">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EBUSY</B>

<DD>
(i386 only) There was an error with allocating or freeing a debug register.
<DT><B>EFAULT</B>

<DD>
There was an attempt to read from or write to an invalid area in
the tracer's or the tracee's memory,
probably because the area wasn't mapped or accessible.
Unfortunately, under Linux, different variations of this fault
will return
<B>EIO</B>

or
<B>EFAULT</B>

more or less arbitrarily.
<DT><B>EINVAL</B>

<DD>
An attempt was made to set an invalid option.
<DT><B>EIO</B>

<DD>
<I>request</I>

is invalid, or an attempt was made to read from or
write to an invalid area in the tracer's or the tracee's memory,
or there was a word-alignment violation,
or an invalid signal was specified during a restart request.
<DT><B>EPERM</B>

<DD>
The specified process cannot be traced.
This could be because the
tracer has insufficient privileges (the required capability is
<B>CAP_SYS_PTRACE</B>);

unprivileged processes cannot trace processes that they
cannot send signals to or those running
set-user-ID/set-group-ID programs, for obvious reasons.
Alternatively, the process may already be being traced,
or (on kernels before 2.6.26) be
<B><A HREF="../man8/init.8.html">init</A></B>(8)

(PID 1).
<DT><B>ESRCH</B>

<DD>
The specified process does not exist, or is not currently being traced
by the caller, or is not stopped
(for requests that require a stopped tracee).

<H2>NOTES</H2>

Although arguments to
<B>ptrace</B>()

are interpreted according to the prototype given,
glibc currently declares
<B>ptrace</B>()

as a variadic function with only the
<I>request</I>

argument fixed.
It is recommended to always supply four arguments,
even if the requested operation does not use them,
setting unused/ignored arguments to
<I>0L</I>

or
<I>(void&nbsp;*)&nbsp;0.</I>

<P>

In Linux kernels before 2.6.26,

<B><A HREF="../man8/init.8.html">init</A></B>(8),

the process with PID 1, may not be traced.
<P>

The layout of the contents of memory and the USER area are
quite operating-system- and architecture-specific.
The offset supplied, and the data returned,
might not entirely match with the definition of
<I>struct user</I>.


<P>

The size of a &quot;word&quot; is determined by the operating-system variant
(e.g., for 32-bit Linux it is 32 bits).
<P>

This page documents the way the
<B>ptrace</B>()

call works currently in Linux.
Its behavior differs noticeably on other flavors of UNIX.
In any case, use of
<B>ptrace</B>()

is highly specific to the operating system and architecture.
<A NAME="lbAU">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>BUGS</H2>

On hosts with 2.6 kernel headers,
<B>PTRACE_SETOPTIONS</B>

is declared with a different value than the one for 2.4.
This leads to applications compiled with 2.6 kernel
headers failing when run on 2.4 kernels.
This can be worked around by redefining
<B>PTRACE_SETOPTIONS</B>

to
<B>PTRACE_OLDSETOPTIONS</B>,

if that is defined.
<P>

Group-stop notifications are sent to the tracer, but not to real parent.
Last confirmed on 2.6.38.6.
<P>

If a thread group leader is traced and exits by calling
<B><A HREF="../man2/_exit.2.html">_exit</A></B>(2),










a
<B>PTRACE_EVENT_EXIT</B>

stop will happen for it (if requested), but the subsequent
<B>WIFEXITED</B>

notification will not be delivered until all other threads exit.
As explained above, if one of other threads calls
<B><A HREF="../man2/execve.2.html">execve</A></B>(2),

the death of the thread group leader will
<I>never</I>

be reported.
If the execed thread is not traced by this tracer,
the tracer will never know that
<B><A HREF="../man2/execve.2.html">execve</A></B>(2)

happened.
One possible workaround is to
<B>PTRACE_DETACH</B>

the thread group leader instead of restarting it in this case.
Last confirmed on 2.6.38.6.

<P>

A
<B>SIGKILL</B>

signal may still cause a
<B>PTRACE_EVENT_EXIT</B>

stop before actual signal death.
This may be changed in the future;
<B>SIGKILL</B>

is meant to always immediately kill tasks even under ptrace.
Last confirmed on 2.6.38.6.
<P>

Some system calls return with
<B>EINTR</B>

if a signal was sent to a tracee, but delivery was suppressed by the tracer.
(This is very typical operation: it is usually
done by debuggers on every attach, in order to not introduce
a bogus
<B>SIGSTOP</B>).

As of Linux 3.2.9, the following system calls are affected
(this list is likely incomplete):
<B><A HREF="../man2/epoll_wait.2.html">epoll_wait</A></B>(2),

and
<B><A HREF="../man2/read.2.html">read</A></B>(2)

from an
<B><A HREF="../man7/inotify.7.html">inotify</A></B>(7)

file descriptor.
The usual symptom of this bug is that when you attach to
a quiescent process with the command
<P>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;strace&nbsp;-p&nbsp;&lt;process-ID&gt;
<P>
then, instead of the usual
and expected one-line output such as
<PRE>

    restart_syscall(&lt;... resuming interrupted call ...&gt;_

</PRE>

or
<PRE>

    select(6, [5], NULL, [5], NULL_

</PRE>

('_' denotes the cursor position), you observe more than one line.
For example:
<PRE>

    clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, {15370, 690928118}) = 0
    epoll_wait(4,_

</PRE>

What is not visible here is that the process was blocked in
<B><A HREF="../man2/epoll_wait.2.html">epoll_wait</A></B>(2)

before
<B><A HREF="../man1/strace.1.html">strace</A></B>(1)

has attached to it.
Attaching caused
<B><A HREF="../man2/epoll_wait.2.html">epoll_wait</A></B>(2)

to return to user space with the error
<B>EINTR</B>.

In this particular case, the program reacted to
<B>EINTR</B>

by checking the current time, and then executing
<B><A HREF="../man2/epoll_wait.2.html">epoll_wait</A></B>(2)

again.
(Programs which do not expect such &quot;stray&quot;
<B>EINTR</B>

errors may behave in an unintended way upon an
<B><A HREF="../man1/strace.1.html">strace</A></B>(1)

attach.)
