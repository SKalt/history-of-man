<B>int semctl(int </B><I>semid</I><B>, int </B><I>semnum</I><B>, int </B><I>cmd</I><B>, ...);</B>
</PRE>

<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B>semctl</B>()

performs the control operation specified by
<I>cmd</I>

on the System&nbsp;V semaphore set identified by
<I>semid</I>,

or on the
<I>semnum</I>-th

semaphore of that set.
(The semaphores in a set are numbered starting at 0.)
<P>

This function has three or four arguments, depending on
<I>cmd</I>.

When there are four, the fourth has the type
<I>union semun</I>.

The <I>calling program</I> must define this union as follows:
<P>
<PRE>
union semun {
    int              val;    /* Value for SETVAL */
    struct semid_ds *buf;    /* Buffer for IPC_STAT, IPC_SET */
    unsigned short  *array;  /* Array for GETALL, SETALL */
    struct seminfo  *__buf;  /* Buffer for IPC_INFO
                                (Linux-specific) */
};
</PRE>

<P>

The
<I>semid_ds</I>

data structure is defined in <I>&lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/sys/sem.h">sys/sem.h</A>&gt;</I> as follows:
<PRE>

struct semid_ds {
    struct ipc_perm sem_perm;  /* Ownership and permissions */
    time_t          sem_otime; /* Last semop time */
    time_t          sem_ctime; /* Last change time */
    unsigned long   sem_nsems; /* No. of semaphores in set */
};
</PRE>

<P>

The
<I>ipc_perm</I>

structure is defined as follows
(the highlighted fields are settable using
<B>IPC_SET</B>):

<P>

<PRE>
struct ipc_perm {
    key_t          __key; /* Key supplied to <A HREF="../man2/semget.2.html">semget</A>(2) */
    uid_t          <B>uid</B>;   /* Effective UID of owner */
    gid_t          <B>gid</B>;   /* Effective GID of owner */
    uid_t          cuid;  /* Effective UID of creator */
    gid_t          cgid;  /* Effective GID of creator */
    unsigned short <B>mode</B>;  /* Permissions */
    unsigned short __seq; /* Sequence number */
};
</PRE>

<P>

Valid values for
<I>cmd</I>

are:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>IPC_STAT</B>

<DD>
Copy information from the kernel data structure associated with
<I>semid</I>

into the
<I>semid_ds</I>

structure pointed to by
<I>arg.buf</I>.

The argument
<I>semnum</I>

is ignored.
The calling process must have read permission on the semaphore set.
<DT><B>IPC_SET</B>

<DD>
Write the values of some members of the
<I>semid_ds</I>

structure pointed to by
<I>arg.buf</I>

to the kernel data structure associated with this semaphore set,
updating also its
<I>sem_ctime</I>

member.
The following members of the structure are updated:
<I>sem_perm.uid</I>,

<I>sem_perm.gid</I>,

and (the least significant 9 bits of)
<I>sem_perm.mode</I>.

The effective UID of the calling process must match the owner
(<I>sem_perm.uid</I>)

or creator
(<I>sem_perm.cuid</I>)

of the semaphore set, or the caller must be privileged.
The argument
<I>semnum</I>

is ignored.
<DT><B>IPC_RMID</B>

<DD>
Immediately remove the semaphore set,
awakening all processes blocked in
<B><A HREF="../man2/semop.2.html">semop</A></B>(2)

calls on the set (with an error return and
<I>errno</I>

set to
<B>EIDRM</B>).

The effective user ID of the calling process must
match the creator or owner of the semaphore set,
or the caller must be privileged.
The argument
<I>semnum</I>

is ignored.
<DT><B>IPC_INFO</B> (Linux-specific)

<DD>
Return information about system-wide semaphore limits and
parameters in the structure pointed to by
<I>arg.__buf</I>.

This structure is of type
<I>seminfo</I>,

defined in
<I>&lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/sys/sem.h">sys/sem.h</A>&gt;</I>

if the
<B>_GNU_SOURCE</B>

feature test macro is defined:
<PRE>

struct  seminfo {
    int semmap;  /* Number of entries in semaphore
                    map; unused within kernel */
    int semmni;  /* Maximum number of semaphore sets */
    int semmns;  /* Maximum number of semaphores in all
                    semaphore sets */
    int semmnu;  /* System-wide maximum number of undo
                    structures; unused within kernel */
    int semmsl;  /* Maximum number of semaphores in a
                    set */
    int semopm;  /* Maximum number of operations for
                    <A HREF="../man2/semop.2.html">semop</A>(2) */
    int semume;  /* Maximum number of undo entries per
                    process; unused within kernel */
    int semusz;  /* Size of struct sem_undo */
    int semvmx;  /* Maximum semaphore value */
    int semaem;  /* Max. value that can be recorded for
                    semaphore adjustment (SEM_UNDO) */
};

</PRE>

The
<I>semmsl</I>,

<I>semmns</I>,

<I>semopm</I>,

and
<I>semmni</I>

settings can be changed via
<I>/proc/sys/kernel/sem</I>;

see
<B><A HREF="../man5/proc.5.html">proc</A></B>(5)

for details.
<DT><B>SEM_INFO</B> (Linux-specific)

<DD>
Return a
<I>seminfo</I>

structure containing the same information as for
<B>IPC_INFO</B>,

except that the following fields are returned with information
about system resources consumed by semaphores: the
<I>semusz</I>

field returns the number of semaphore sets that currently exist
on the system; and the
<I>semaem</I>

field returns the total number of semaphores in all semaphore sets
on the system.
<DT><B>SEM_STAT</B> (Linux-specific)

<DD>
Return a
<I>semid_ds</I>

structure as for
<B>IPC_STAT</B>.

However, the
<I>semid</I>

argument is not a semaphore identifier, but instead an index into
the kernel's internal array that maintains information about
all semaphore sets on the system.
<DT><B>GETALL</B>

<DD>
Return
<B>semval</B>

(i.e., the current value)
for all semaphores of the set into
<I>arg.array</I>.

The argument
<I>semnum</I>

is ignored.
The calling process must have read permission on the semaphore set.
<DT><B>GETNCNT</B>

<DD>
Return the value of
<B>semncnt</B>

for the
<I>semnum</I>-th

semaphore of the set
(i.e., the number of processes waiting for an increase of
<B>semval</B>

for the
<I>semnum</I>-th

semaphore of the set).
The calling process must have read permission on the semaphore set.
<DT><B>GETPID</B>

<DD>
Return the value of
<B>sempid</B>

for the
<I>semnum</I>-th

semaphore of the set
(i.e., the PID of the process that executed the last
<B><A HREF="../man2/semop.2.html">semop</A></B>(2)

call for the
<I>semnum</I>-th

semaphore of the set).
The calling process must have read permission on the semaphore set.
<DT><B>GETVAL</B>

<DD>
Return the value of
<B>semval</B>

for the
<I>semnum</I>-th

semaphore of the set.
The calling process must have read permission on the semaphore set.
<DT><B>GETZCNT</B>

<DD>
Return the value of
<B>semzcnt</B>

for the
<I>semnum</I>-th

semaphore of the set
(i.e., the number of processes waiting for
<B>semval</B>

of the
<I>semnum</I>-th

semaphore of the set to become 0).
The calling process must have read permission on the semaphore set.
<DT><B>SETALL</B>

<DD>
Set
<B>semval</B>

for all semaphores of the set using
<I>arg.array</I>,

updating also the
<I>sem_ctime</I>

member of the
<I>semid_ds</I>

structure associated with the set.
Undo entries (see
<B><A HREF="../man2/semop.2.html">semop</A></B>(2))

are cleared for altered semaphores in all processes.
If the changes to semaphore values would permit blocked
<B><A HREF="../man2/semop.2.html">semop</A></B>(2)

calls in other processes to proceed, then those processes are woken up.
The argument
<I>semnum</I>

is ignored.
The calling process must have alter (write) permission on
the semaphore set.
<DT><B>SETVAL</B>

<DD>
Set the value of
<B>semval</B>

to
<I>arg.val</I>

for the
<I>semnum</I>-th

semaphore of the set, updating also the
<I>sem_ctime</I>

member of the
<I>semid_ds</I>

structure associated with the set.
Undo entries are cleared for altered semaphores in all processes.
If the changes to semaphore values would permit blocked
<B><A HREF="../man2/semop.2.html">semop</A></B>(2)

calls in other processes to proceed, then those processes are woken up.
The calling process must have alter permission on the semaphore set.

<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>CONFORMING TO</H2>

SVr4, POSIX.1-2001.

<P>
POSIX.1-2001 specifies the
<I>sem_nsems</I>

field of the
<I>semid_ds</I>

structure as having the type
<I>unsigned&nbsp;short</I>,

and the field is so defined on most other systems.
It was also so defined on Linux 2.2 and earlier,
but, since Linux 2.4, the field has the type
<I>unsigned&nbsp;long</I>.

<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NOTES</H2>

The inclusion of
<I>&lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/sys/types.h">sys/types.h</A>&gt;</I>

and
<I>&lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/sys/ipc.h">sys/ipc.h</A>&gt;</I>

isn't required on Linux or by any version of POSIX.
However,
some old implementations required the inclusion of these header files,
and the SVID also documented their inclusion.
Applications intended to be portable to such old systems may need
to include these header files.


<P>
The
<B>IPC_INFO</B>,

<B>SEM_STAT</B>

and
<B>SEM_INFO</B>

operations are used by the
<B><A HREF="../man1/ipcs.1.html">ipcs</A></B>(1)

program to provide information on allocated resources.
In the future these may modified or moved to a
<I>/proc</I>

filesystem interface.
<P>

Various fields in a <I>struct semid_ds</I> were typed as
<I>short</I>

under Linux 2.2
and have become
<I>long</I>

under Linux 2.4.
To take advantage of this,
a recompilation under glibc-2.1.91 or later should suffice.
(The kernel distinguishes old and new calls by an
<B>IPC_64</B>

flag in
<I>cmd</I>.)

<P>

In some earlier versions of glibc, the
<I>semun</I>

union was defined in <I>&lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/sys/sem.h">sys/sem.h</A>&gt;</I>, but POSIX.1-2001 requires
that the caller define this union.
On versions of glibc where this union is <I>not</I> defined,
the macro
<B>_SEM_SEMUN_UNDEFINED</B>

is defined in <I>&lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/sys/sem.h">sys/sem.h</A>&gt;</I>.
<P>

The following system limit on semaphore sets affects a
<B>semctl</B>()

call:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>SEMVMX</B>

<DD>
Maximum value for
<B>semval</B>:

implementation dependent (32767).
</DL>
<P>

For greater portability, it is best to always call
<B>semctl</B>()

with four arguments.
