<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

A semaphore is represented by an anonymous structure
including the following members:
<P>

<PRE>
unsigned short  semval;   /* semaphore value */
unsigned short  semzcnt;  /* # waiting for zero */
unsigned short  semncnt;  /* # waiting for increase */
pid_t           sempid;   /* process that did last op */

</PRE>

The function
<B>semop</B>

performs operations on selected members of the semaphore set indicated by
<I>semid</I>.

Each of the
<I>nsops</I>

elements in the array pointed to by
<I>sops</I>

specifies an operation to be performed on a semaphore by a
<B>struct sembuf</B>

including the following members:
<P>

<PRE>
unsigned short sem_num; /* semaphore number */
short sem_op;                   /* semaphore operation */
short sem_flg;                  /* operation flags */

</PRE>

Flags recognized in
<I>sem_flg</I>

are
<B>IPC_NOWAIT</B>

and
<B>SEM_UNDO</B>.

If an operation asserts
<B>SEM_UNDO</B>,

it will be undone when the process exits.
<P>

The set of operations contained in
<I>sops</I>

is performed
<I>atomically</I>,

that is, the operations are performed at the same time, and only
if they can all be simultaneously performed.
The behaviour of the system call if not all operations can be
performed immediately depends on the presence of the
<B>IPC_NOWAIT</B>

flag in the individual
<I>sem_flg</I>

fields, as noted below.
<P>
Each operation is performed on the
<I>sem_num</I>-th

semaphore of the semaphore set, where the first semaphore of the set
is semaphore
<B>0</B>.

There are three types of operation, distinguished by the value of
<I>sem_op</I>.

<P>

If
<I>sem_op</I>

is a positive integer, the operation adds this value to
the semaphore value
(<I>semval</I>).

Furthermore, if
<B>SEM_UNDO</B>

is asserted for this operation, the system updates the process undo count
(<I>semadj</I>)

for this semaphore.
This operation can always proceed - it never forces a process to wait.
The calling process must have alter permission on the semaphore set.
<P>

If
<I>sem_op</I>

is zero, the process must have read access permission on the semaphore
set.
This is a &quot;wait-for-zero&quot; operation: if
<I>semval</I>

is zero, the operation can immediately proceed.
Otherwise, if
<B>IPC_NOWAIT</B>

is asserted in
<I>sem_flg</I>,

the system call fails with
<I>errno</I>

set to
<B>EAGAIN</B>

(and none of the operations in
<I>sops</I>

is performed).
Otherwise
<I>semzcnt</I>

(the count of processes waiting until this semaphore's value becomes zero)
is incremented by one and the process sleeps until
one of the following occurs:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>&bull;<DD>
<I>semval</I>

becomes 0, at which time the value of
<I>semzcnt</I>

is decremented.
<DT>&bull;<DD>
The semaphore set
is removed: the system call fails, with
<I>errno</I>

set to
<B>EIDRM</B>.

<DT>&bull;<DD>
The calling process catches a signal:
the value of
<I>semzcnt</I>

is decremented and the system call fails, with
<I>errno</I>

set to
<B>EINTR</B>.

<DT>&bull;<DD>
The time limit specified by
<I>timeout</I>

in a
<B>semtimedop</B>

call expires: the system call fails, with
<I>errno</I>

set to
<B>EAGAIN</B>.

</DL>
<P>

If
<I>sem_op</I>

is less than zero, the process must have alter permission on the
semaphore set.
If
<I>semval</I>

is greater than or equal to the absolute value of
<I>sem_op</I>,

the operation can proceed immediately:
the absolute value of
<I>sem_op</I>

is subtracted from
<I>semval</I>,

and, if
<B>SEM_UNDO</B>

is asserted for this operation, the system updates the process undo count
(<I>semadj</I>)

for this semaphore.
If the absolute value of
<I>sem_op</I>

is greater than
<I>semval</I>,

and
<B>IPC_NOWAIT</B>

is asserted in
<I>sem_flg</I>,

the system call fails, with
<I>errno</I>

set to
<B>EAGAIN</B>

(and none of the operations in
<I>sops</I>

is performed).
Otherwise
<I>semncnt</I>

(the counter of processes waiting for this semaphore's value to increase)
is incremented by one and the process sleeps until
one of the following occurs:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>&bull;<DD>
<I>semval</I>

becomes greater than or equal to the absolute value of
<I>sem_op</I>,

at which time the value of
<I>semncnt</I>

is decremented, the absolute value of
<I>sem_op</I>

is subtracted from
<I>semval</I>

and, if
<B>SEM_UNDO</B>

is asserted for this operation, the system updates the process undo count
(<I>semadj</I>)

for this semaphore.
<DT>&bull;<DD>
The semaphore set is removed from the system: the system call fails with
<I>errno</I>

set to
<B>EIDRM</B>.

<DT>&bull;<DD>
The calling process catches a signal:
the value of
<I>semncnt</I>

is decremented and the system call fails with
<I>errno</I>

set to
<B>EINTR</B>.

<DT>&bull;<DD>
The time limit specified by
<I>timeout</I>

in a
<B>semtimedop</B>

call expires: the system call fails, with
<I>errno</I>

set to
<B>EAGAIN</B>.

</DL>
<P>

On successful completion, the
<I>sempid</I>

value for each semaphore specified in the array pointed to by
<I>sops</I>

is set to the process ID of the calling process.
In addition, the
<I>sem_otime</I>



is set to the current time.
<P>

The function
<B>semtimedop</B>

behaves identically to the function
<B>semop</B>

except that in those cases were the calling process would sleep,
the duration of that sleep is limited by the amount of elapsed
time specified by the
<B>timespec</B>

structure whose address is passed in the
<I>timeout</I>

parameter.  If the specified time limit has been reached,
the system call fails with
<I>errno</I>

set to
<B>EAGAIN</B>

(and none of the operations in
<I>sops</I>

is performed).
If the
<I>timeout</I>

parameter is
<B>NULL</B>,

then
<B>semtimedop</B>

behaves exactly like
<B>semop</B>.

<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

If successful the system call returns
<B>0</B>,

otherwise it returns
<B>-1</B>

with
<I>errno</I>

indicating the error.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>

the maximum number of operations allowed per system

<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NOTES</H2>

The
<I>sem_undo</I>

structures of a process aren't inherited across a
<B><A HREF="../man2/fork.2.html">fork</A></B>(2)

system call, but they are inherited across a
<B><A HREF="../man2/execve.2.html">execve</A></B>(2)

system call.
<P>

<B>semop</B>

is never automatically restarted after being interrupted by a signal handler,
regardless of the setting of the
<B>SA_RESTART</B>

flags when establishing a signal handler.
<P>

<I>semadj</I>

is a per-process integer which is simply the (negative) count
of all semaphore operations performed specifying the
<B>SEM_UNDO</B>

flag.
When a semaphore's value is directly set using the
<B>SETVAL</B>

or
<B>SETALL</B>

request to
<B><A HREF="../man2/semctl.2.html">semctl</A></B>(2),

the corresponding
<I>semadj</I>

values in all processes are cleared.
<P>

The <I>semval</I>, <I>sempid</I>, <I>semzcnt</I>, and <I>semnct</I> values
for a semaphore can all be retrieved using appropriate
<B><A HREF="../man2/semctl.2.html">semctl</A></B>(2)

calls.
<P>

The followings are limits on semaphore set resources affecting a
<B>semop</B>

call:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>SEMOPM</B>

<DD>
Maximum number of operations allowed for one
<B>semop</B>

call (32).
<DT><B>SEMVMX</B>

<DD>
Maximum allowable value for
<I>semval</I>:

implementation dependent (32767).
</DL>
<P>

The implementation has no intrinsic limits for
the adjust on exit maximum value
(<B>SEMAEM</B>),

the system wide maximum number of undo structures
(<B>SEMMNU</B>)

and the per-process maximum number of undo entries system parameters.
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>BUGS</H2>

When a process terminates, its set of associated
<I>semadj</I>

structures is used to undo the effect of all of the
semaphore operations it performed with the
<B>SEM_UNDO</B>

flag.
This raises a difficulty: if one (or more) of these semaphore adjustments
would result in an attempt to decrease a semaphore's value below zero,
what should an implementation do?
One possible approach would be to block until all the semaphore
adjustments could be performed.
This is however undesirable since it could force process termination to
block for arbitrarily long periods.
Another possibility is that such semaphore adjustments could be ignored
altogether (somewhat analogously to failing when
<B>IPC_NOWAIT</B>

is specified for a semaphore operation).
Linux adopts a third approach: decreasing the semaphore value
as far as possible (i.e., to zero) and allowing process
termination to proceed immediately.
