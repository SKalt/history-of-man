<H2>NAME</H2>

setfsuid - set user identity used for file system checks
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>#include &lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/unistd.h">unistd.h</A>&gt;</B>

/* glibc uses &lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/sys/fsuid.h">sys/fsuid.h</A>&gt; */
<P>
<B>int setfsuid(uid_t </B><I>fsuid</I><B>);</B>

<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The system call
<B>setfsuid</B>()

sets the user ID that the Linux kernel uses to check for all accesses
to the file system.
Normally, the value of
<I>fsuid</I>

will shadow the value of the effective user ID.
In fact, whenever the
effective user ID is changed,
<I>fsuid</I>

will also be changed to the new value of the effective user ID.
<P>
Explicit calls to
<B>setfsuid</B>()

and
<B><A HREF="../man2/setfsgid.2.html">setfsgid</A></B>(2)

are usually used only by programs such as the Linux NFS server that
need to change what user and group ID is used for file access without a
corresponding change in the real and effective user and group IDs.
A change in the normal user IDs for a program such as the NFS server
is a security hole that can expose it to unwanted signals.
(But see below.)
<P>
<B>setfsuid</B>()

will succeed only if the caller is the superuser or if
<I>fsuid</I>

matches either the real user ID, effective user ID, saved set-user-ID, or
the current value of
<I>fsuid</I>.

<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

On success, the previous value of
<I>fsuid</I>

is returned.
On error, the current value of
<I>fsuid</I>

is returned.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>VERSIONS</H2>

This system call is present in Linux since version 1.2.


<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>CONFORMING TO</H2>

<B>setfsuid</B>()

is Linux-specific and should not be used in programs intended
to be portable.
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NOTES</H2>

When glibc determines that the argument is not a valid user ID,
it will return -1 and set <I>errno</I> to
<B>EINVAL</B>

without attempting
the system call.
<P>

Note that at the time this system call was introduced, a process
could send a signal to a process with the same effective user ID.
Today signal permission handling is slightly different.
<P>
The original Linux
<B>setfsuid</B>()

system call supported only 16-bit user IDs.
Subsequently, Linux 2.4 added
<B>setfsuid32</B>()

supporting 32-bit IDs.
The glibc
<B>setfsuid</B>()

wrapper function transparently deals with the variation across kernel versions.
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>BUGS</H2>

No error messages of any kind are returned to the caller.
At the very
least,
<B>EPERM</B>

should be returned when the call fails (because the caller lacks the
<B>CAP_SETUID</B>

capability).
