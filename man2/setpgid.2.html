<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B>setpgid</B>()

sets the process group ID of the process specified by
<I>pid</I>

to
<I>pgid</I>.

If
<I>pid</I>

is zero, the process ID of the current process is used.  If
<I>pgid</I>

is zero, the process ID of the process specified by
<I>pid</I>

is used.  If <B>setpgid</B>() is used to move a process from one process
group to another (as is done by some shells when creating pipelines),
both process groups must be part of the same session.  In this case,
the <I>pgid</I> specifies an existing process group to be joined and the
session ID of that group must match the session ID of the joining process.
<P>
<B>getpgid</B>()

returns the process group ID of the process specified by
<I>pid</I>.

If
<I>pid</I>

is zero, the process ID of the current process is used.
<P>
The call
<B>setpgrp</B>()

is equivalent to
<B>setpgid(0,0)</B>.

<P>
Similarly,
<B>getpgrp</B>()

is equivalent to
<B>getpgid(0)</B>.

Each process group is a member of a session and each process is a
member of the session of which its process group is a member.
<P>
Process groups are used for distribution of signals, and by terminals to
arbitrate requests for their input: Processes that have the same process
group as the terminal are foreground and may read, while others will
block with a signal if they attempt to read.
These calls are thus used by programs such as
<B><A HREF="../man1/csh.1.html">csh</A></B>(1)

to create process groups in implementing job control.  The
<B>TIOCGPGRP</B>

and
<B>TIOCSPGRP</B>

calls described in
<B><A HREF="../man3/termios.3.html">termios</A></B>(3)

are used to get/set the process group of the control terminal.
<P>
If a session has a controlling terminal, CLOCAL is not set and a hangup
occurs, then the session leader is sent a SIGHUP.  If the session leader
exits, the SIGHUP signal will be sent to each process in the foreground
process group of the controlling terminal.
<P>
If the exit of the process causes a process group to become orphaned,
and if any member of the newly-orphaned process group is stopped, then a
SIGHUP signal followed by a SIGCONT signal will be sent to each process
in the newly-orphaned process group.

<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

On success,
<B>setpgid</B>()

and 
<B>setpgrp</B>()

return zero.  On error, -1 is returned, and
<I>errno</I>

is set appropriately.
<P>
<B>getpgid</B>()

returns a process group on success.
On error, -1 is returned, and
<I>errno</I>

is set appropriately.
<P>
<B>getpgrp</B>()

always returns the current process group.

<H2>ERRORS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EACCES</B>

<DD>
An attempt was made to change the process group ID
of one of the children of the calling process and the child had
already performed an <B>execve</B>()
(<B>setpgid</B>(), <B>setpgrp</B>()).
<DT><B>EINVAL</B>

<DD>
<I>pgid</I>

is less than 0
(<B>setpgid</B>(), <B>setpgrp</B>()).
<DT><B>EPERM</B>

<DD>
An attempt was made to move a process into a process group in a 
different session, or to change the process 
group ID of one of the children of the calling process and the 
child was in a different session, or to change the process group ID of
a session leader
(<B>setpgid</B>(), <B>setpgrp</B>()).
<DT><B>ESRCH</B>

<DD>
For
<B>getpgid</B>():

<I>pid</I>

does not match any process.
For
<B>setpgid</B>():

<I>pid</I>

is not the current process and not a child of the current process.

<H2>CONFORMING TO</H2>

The functions
<B>setpgid</B>()

and
<B>getpgrp</B>()

conform to POSIX.1.
The function
<B>setpgrp</B>()

is from 4.2BSD.
The function
<B>getpgid</B>()

conforms to SVr4.
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NOTES</H2>

POSIX took
<B>setpgid</B>()

from the BSD function
<B>setpgrp</B>().

Also System V has a function with the same name, but it is identical to
<B><A HREF="../man2/setsid.2.html">setsid</A></B>(2).

<P>

To get the prototypes under glibc, define both _XOPEN_SOURCE and
_XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED, or use &quot;#define _XOPEN_SOURCE <I>n</I>&quot;
for some integer <I>n</I> larger than or equal to 500.
