<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B>setresuid</B>()

sets the real user ID, the effective user ID, and the
saved set-user-ID of the calling process.
<P>
Unprivileged user processes
may change the real UID,
effective UID, and saved set-user-ID, each to one of:
the current real UID, the current effective UID or the
current saved set-user-ID.
<P>
Privileged processes (on Linux, those having the <B>CAP_SETUID</B> capability)
may set the real UID, effective UID, and
saved set-user-ID to arbitrary values.
<P>
If one of the arguments equals -1, the corresponding value is not changed.
<P>
Regardless of what changes are made to the real UID, effective UID,
and saved set-user-ID, the filesystem UID is always set to the same
value as the (possibly new) effective UID.
<P>
Completely analogously,
<B>setresgid</B>()

sets the real GID, effective GID, and saved set-group-ID
of the calling process (and always modifies the filesystem GID
to be the same as the effective GID),
with the same restrictions for unprivileged processes.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

On success, zero is returned.
On error, -1 is returned, and
<I>errno</I>

is set appropriately.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EAGAIN</B>

<DD>
<I>uid</I>

does not match the current UID and this call would
bring that user ID over its
<B>RLIMIT_NPROC</B>

resource limit.
<DT><B>EPERM</B>

<DD>
The calling process is not privileged (did not have the <B>CAP_SETUID</B>
capability) and tried to change the IDs to values that are not permitted.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>VERSIONS</H2>

These calls are available under Linux since Linux 2.1.44.
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>CONFORMING TO</H2>

These calls are nonstandard;
they also appear on HP-UX and some of the BSDs.
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NOTES</H2>

Under HP-UX and FreeBSD, the prototype is found in
<I>&lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/unistd.h">unistd.h</A>&gt;</I>.

Under Linux the prototype is provided by glibc since version 2.3.2.
<P>
The original Linux
<B>setresuid</B>()

and
<B>setresgid</B>()

system calls supported only 16-bit user and group IDs.
Subsequently, Linux 2.4 added
<B>setresuid32</B>()

and
<B>setresgid32</B>(),

supporting 32-bit IDs.
The glibc
<B>setresuid</B>()

and
<B>setresgid</B>()

wrapper functions transparently deal with the variations across kernel versions.
