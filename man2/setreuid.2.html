<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B>setreuid</B>()

sets real and effective user IDs of the calling process.
<P>
Supplying a value of -1 for either the real or effective user ID forces
the system to leave that ID unchanged.
<P>
Unprivileged processes may only set the effective user ID to the real user ID,
the effective user ID, or the saved set-user-ID.
<P>
Unprivileged users may only set the real user ID to
the real user ID or the effective user ID.
<P>
If the real user ID is set (i.e.,
<I>ruid</I>

is not -1) or the effective user ID is set to a value
not equal to the previous real user ID,
the saved set-user-ID will be set to the new effective user ID.
<P>
Completely analogously,
<B>setregid</B>()

sets real and effective group ID's of the calling process,
and all of the above holds with &quot;group&quot; instead of &quot;user&quot;.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

On success, zero is returned.
On error, -1 is returned, and
<I>errno</I>

is set appropriately.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EPERM</B>

<DD>
The calling process is not privileged
(Linux: does not have the
<B>CAP_SETUID</B>

capability in the case of
<B>setreuid</B>(),

or the
<B>CAP_SETGID</B>

capability in the case of
<B>setregid</B>())

and a change other than (i)
swapping the effective user (group) ID with the real user (group) ID,
or (ii) setting one to the value of the other or (iii) setting the
effective user (group) ID to the value of the
saved set-user-ID (saved set-group-ID) was specified.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>CONFORMING TO</H2>

POSIX.1-2001, 4.3BSD (the
<B>setreuid</B>()

and
<B>setregid</B>()

function calls first appeared in 4.2BSD).
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NOTES</H2>

Setting the effective user (group) ID to the
saved set-user-ID (saved set-group-ID) is
possible since Linux 1.1.37 (1.1.38).
<P>
POSIX.1 does not specify all of possible ID changes that are permitted
on Linux for an unprivileged process.
For
<B>setreuid</B>(),

the effective user ID can be made the same as the
real user ID or the save set-user-ID,
and it is unspecified whether unprivileged processes may set the
real user ID to the real user ID, the effective user ID, or the
saved set-user-ID.
For
<B>setregid</B>(),

the real group ID can be changed to the value of the saved set-group-ID,
and the effective group ID can be changed to the value of
the real group ID or the saved set-group-ID.
The precise details of what ID changes are permitted vary
across implementations.
<P>
POSIX.1 makes no specification about the effect of these calls
on the saved set-user-ID and saved set-group-ID.
<P>
The original Linux
<B>setreuid</B>()

and
<B>setregid</B>()

system calls supported only 16-bit user and group IDs.
Subsequently, Linux 2.4 added
<B>setreuid32</B>()

and
<B>setregid32</B>(),

supporting 32-bit IDs.
The glibc
<B>setreuid</B>()

and
<B>setregid</B>()

wrapper functions transparently deal with the variations across kernel versions.
