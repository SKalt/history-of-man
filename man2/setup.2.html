<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B>setup</B>()

is called once from within
<I>linux/init/main.c</I>.

It calls initialization functions for devices and filesystems
configured into the kernel and then mounts the root filesystem.
<P>

No user process may call
<B>setup</B>().

Any user process, even a process with superuser permission,
will receive
<B>EPERM</B>.

<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

<B>setup</B>()

always returns -1 for a user process.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>

<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>CONFORMING TO</H2>

This function is Linux-specific, and should not be used in programs
intended to be portable, or indeed in any programs at all.
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NOTES</H2>

The calling sequence varied: at some times
<B>setup</B>()

has had a single argument
<I>void&nbsp;*BIOS</I>

and at other times a single argument
<I>int magic</I>.
