<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B>shmat</B>()

attaches the shared memory segment identified by
<I>shmid</I>

to the address space of the calling process.
The attaching address is specified by
<I>shmaddr</I>

with one of the following criteria:
<P>

If
<I>shmaddr</I>

is
<B>NULL</B>,

the system chooses a suitable (unused) address at which to attach
the segment.
<P>

If
<I>shmaddr</I>

isn't
<B>NULL</B>

and
<B>SHM_RND</B>

is specified in
<I>shmflg</I>,

the attach occurs at the address equal to
<I>shmaddr</I>

rounded down to the nearest multiple of
<B>SHMLBA</B>.

Otherwise
<I>shmaddr</I>

must be a page-aligned address at which the attach occurs.
<P>

If
<B>SHM_RDONLY</B>

is specified in
<I>shmflg</I>,

the segment is attached for reading and the process must have
read permission for the segment.
Otherwise the segment is attached for read and write
and the process must have read and write permission for the segment.
There is no notion of a write-only shared memory segment.
<P>

The (Linux-specific)
<B>SHM_REMAP</B>

flag may be specified in
<I>shmflg</I>

to indicate that the mapping of the segment should replace
any existing mapping in the range starting at
<I>shmaddr</I>

and continuing for the size of the segment.
(Normally an
<B>EINVAL</B>

error would result if a mapping already exists in this address range.)
In this case,
<I>shmaddr</I>

must not be
<B>NULL</B>.

<P>

The
<B><A HREF="../man2/brk.2.html">brk</A></B>(2)

value of the calling process is not altered by the attach.
The segment will automatically be detached at process exit.
The same segment may be attached as a read and as a read-write
one, and more than once, in the process's address space.
<P>

A successful
<B>shmat</B>()

call updates the members of the
<B>shmid_ds</B>

structure (see
<B><A HREF="../man2/shmctl.2.html">shmctl</A></B>(2))

associated with the shared memory segment as follows:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
<I>shm_atime</I>

is set to the current time.
<DT><DD>
<I>shm_lpid</I>

is set to the process-ID of the calling process.
<DT><DD>
<I>shm_nattch</I>

is incremented by one.
</DL>
<P>

<B>shmdt</B>()

detaches the shared memory segment located at the address specified by
<I>shmaddr</I>

from the address space of the calling process.
The to-be-detached segment must be currently
attached with
<I>shmaddr</I>

equal to the value returned by the attaching
<B>shmat</B>()

call.
<P>

On a successful
<B>shmdt</B>()

call the system updates the members of the
<I>shmid_ds</I>

structure associated with the shared memory segment as follows:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
<I>shm_dtime</I>

is set to the current time.
<DT><DD>
<I>shm_lpid</I>

is set to the process-ID of the calling process.
<DT><DD>
<I>shm_nattch</I>

is decremented by one.
If it becomes 0 and the segment is marked for deletion,
the segment is deleted.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYSTEM CALLS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>fork</B>()

<DD>
After a
<B>fork</B>()

the child inherits the attached shared memory segments.
<DT><B>exec</B>()

<DD>
After an
<B>exec</B>()

all attached shared memory segments are detached from the process.
<DT><B>exit</B>()

<DD>
Upon
<B>exit</B>()

all attached shared memory segments are detached from the process.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

On success
<B>shmat</B>()

returns the address of the attached shared memory segment, and
<B>shmdt</B>()

returns 0.
On failure both functions return -1 with
<I>errno</I>

indicating the error.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

When
<B>shmat</B>()

fails,
<I>errno</I>

is set to one of the following:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EACCES</B>

<DD>
The calling process does not have the required permissions for
the requested attach type, and does not have the
<B>CAP_IPC_OWNER</B>

capability.
<DT><B>EINVAL</B>

<DD>
Invalid
<I>shmid</I>

value, unaligned (i.e., not page-aligned and <B>SHM_RND</B> was not
specified) or invalid
<I>shmaddr</I>

value, or failing attach at
<B>brk</B>,


or
<B>SHM_REMAP</B>

was specified and
<I>shmaddr</I>

was
<B>NULL</B>.

<DT><B>ENOMEM</B>

<DD>
Could not allocate memory for the descriptor or for the page tables.
</DL>
<P>

<B>shmdt</B>()

can fail only if there is no shared memory segment attached at
<I>shmaddr</I>;

in this case,
<I>errno</I>

will be set to
<B>EINVAL</B>.

<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NOTES</H2>

Using
<B>shmat</B>()

with
<I>shmaddr</I>

equal to
<B>NULL</B>

is the preferred, portable way of attaching a shared memory segment.
Be aware that the shared memory segment attached in this way
may be attached at different addresses in different processes.
Therefore, any pointers maintained within the shared memory must be
made relative (typically to the starting address of the segment),
rather than absolute.
<P>

On Linux, it is possible to attach a shared memory segment even if it
already marked to be deleted.
However, POSIX.1-2001 does not specify this behaviour and
many other implementations do not support it.
<P>

The following system parameter affects
<B>shmat</B>():

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>SHMLBA</B>

Segment low boundary address multiple.
Must be page aligned.
For the current implementation the
<B>SHMLBA</B>

value is
<B>PAGE_SIZE</B>.



</DL>
<P>

The implementation places no intrinsic limit on the per-process maximum
number of shared memory segments
(<B>SHMSEG</B>).

<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>CONFORMING TO</H2>

SVr4, SVID.  SVr4 documents an additional error condition EMFILE.
In SVID-v4 the type of the <I>shmaddr</I> argument was changed from
<B>char *</B>

into
<B>const void *</B>,

and the returned type of <I>shmat</I>() from
<B>char *</B>

into
<B>void *</B>.

(Linux libc4 and libc5 have the
<B>char *</B>

prototypes; glibc2 has
<B>void *</B>.)
