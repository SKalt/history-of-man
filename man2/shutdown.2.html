shutdown - shut down part of a full-duplex connection
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>#include &lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/sys/socket.h">sys/socket.h</A>&gt;</B>

<P>
<B>int shutdown(int </B><I>sockfd</I><B>, int </B><I>how</I><B>);</B>

<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The
<B>shutdown</B>()

call causes all or part of a full-duplex connection on the socket
associated with
<I>sockfd</I>

to be shut down.
If
<I>how</I>

is
<B>SHUT_RD</B>,

further receptions will be disallowed.
If
<I>how</I>

is
<B>SHUT_WR</B>,

further transmissions will be disallowed.
If
<I>how</I>

is
<B>SHUT_RDWR</B>,

further receptions and transmissions will be disallowed.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

On success, zero is returned.
On error, -1 is returned, and
<I>errno</I>

is set appropriately.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EBADF</B>

<DD>
<I>sockfd</I>

is not a valid descriptor.
<DT><B>EINVAL</B>

<DD>
An invalid value was specified in
<I>how</I>

(but see BUGS).
<DT><B>ENOTCONN</B>

<DD>
The specified socket is not connected.
<DT><B>ENOTSOCK</B>

<DD>
<I>sockfd</I>

is a file, not a socket.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>CONFORMING TO</H2>

POSIX.1-2001, 4.4BSD (the
<B>shutdown</B>()

function call first appeared in 4.2BSD).
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NOTES</H2>

The constants
<B>SHUT_RD</B>,

<B>SHUT_WR</B>,

<B>SHUT_RDWR</B>

have the value 0, 1, 2,
respectively, and are defined in
<I>&lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/sys/socket.h">sys/socket.h</A>&gt;</I>

since glibc-2.1.91.
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>BUGS</H2>

As currently implemented,
checks for the validity of
<I>how</I>

are done in domain-specific code, and not all domains perform these checks.


Most notably, UNIX domain sockets simply ignore invalid values;
this may change in the future.
