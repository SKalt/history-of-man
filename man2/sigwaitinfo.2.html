<P>
<B>sigwaitinfo</B>(),

<B>sigtimedwait</B>():

_POSIX_C_SOURCE&nbsp;&gt;=&nbsp;199309L
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B>sigwaitinfo</B>()

suspends execution of the calling thread until one of the signals in
<I>set</I>

is pending
(If one of the signals in
<I>set</I>

is already pending for the calling thread,
<B>sigwaitinfo</B>()

will return immediately.)
<P>
<B>sigwaitinfo</B>()

removes the signal from the set of pending
signals and returns the signal number as its function result.
If the
<I>info</I>

argument is not NULL,
then the buffer that it points to is used to return a structure of type
<I>siginfo_t</I>

(see
<B><A HREF="../man2/sigaction.2.html">sigaction</A></B>(2))

containing information about the signal.
<P>

If multiple signals in
<I>set</I>

are pending for the caller, the signal that is retrieved by
<B>sigwaitinfo</B>()

is determined according to the usual ordering rules; see
<B><A HREF="../man7/signal.7.html">signal</A></B>(7)

for further details.
<P>

<B>sigtimedwait</B>()

operates in exactly the same way as
<B>sigwaitinfo</B>()

except that it has an additional argument,
<I>timeout</I>,

which specifies the interval for which
the thread is suspended waiting for a signal.
(This interval will be rounded up to the system clock granularity,
and kernel scheduling delays mean that the interval
may overrun by a small amount.)
This argument is of the following type:
<P>

<PRE>
struct timespec {
    long    tv_sec;         /* seconds */
    long    tv_nsec;        /* nanoseconds */
}
</PRE>


<P>
If both fields of this structure are specified as 0, a poll is performed:
<B>sigtimedwait</B>()

returns immediately, either with information about a signal that
was pending for the caller, or with an error
if none of the signals in
<I>set</I>

was pending.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

On success, both
<B>sigwaitinfo</B>()

and
<B>sigtimedwait</B>()

return a signal number (i.e., a value greater than zero).
On failure both calls return -1, with
<I>errno</I>

set to indicate the error.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EAGAIN</B>

<DD>
No signal in
<I>set</I>

was became pending within the
<I>timeout</I>

period specified to
<B>sigtimedwait</B>().

<DT><B>EINTR</B>

<DD>
The wait was interrupted by a signal handler; see
<B><A HREF="../man7/signal.7.html">signal</A></B>(7).

(This handler was for a signal other than one of those in
<I>set</I>.)

<DT><B>EINVAL</B>

<DD>
<I>timeout</I>

was invalid.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>CONFORMING TO</H2>

POSIX.1-2001.
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NOTES</H2>

In normal usage, the calling program blocks the signals in
<I>set</I>

via a prior call to
<B><A HREF="../man2/sigprocmask.2.html">sigprocmask</A></B>(2)

(so that the default disposition for these signals does not occur if they
become pending between successive calls to
<B>sigwaitinfo</B>()

or
<B>sigtimedwait</B>())

and does not establish handlers for these signals.
In a multithreaded program,
the signal should be blocked in all threads, in order to prevent
the signal being treated according to its default disposition in
a thread other than the one calling
<B>sigwaitinfo</B>()

or
<B>sigtimedwait</B>()).

<P>
The set of signals that is pending for a given thread is the
union of the set of signals that is pending specifically for that thread
and the set of signals that is pending for the process as a whole (see
<B><A HREF="../man7/signal.7.html">signal</A></B>(7)).

<P>
Attempts to wait for
<B>SIGKILL</B>

and
<B>SIGSTOP</B>

are silently ignored.
<P>
If multiple threads of a process are blocked
waiting for the same signal(s) in
<B>sigwaitinfo</B>()

or
<B>sigtimedwait</B>(),

then exactly one of the threads will actually receive the
signal if it becomes pending for the process as a whole;
which of the threads receives the signal is indeterminate.
<P>
POSIX leaves the meaning of a NULL value for the
<I>timeout</I>

argument of
<B>sigtimedwait</B>()

unspecified, permitting the possibility that this has the same meaning
as a call to
<B>sigwaitinfo</B>(),

and indeed this is what is done on Linux.

<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>C library/kernel differences</H3>

On Linux,
<B>sigwaitinfo</B>()

is a library function implemented on top of
<B>sigtimedwait</B>().

<P>
The glibc wrapper functions for
<B>sigwaitinfo</B>()

and
<B>sigtimedwait</B>()

silently ignore attempts to wait for the two real-time signals that
are used internally by the NPTL threading implementation.
See
<B><A HREF="../man7/nptl.7.html">nptl</A></B>(7)

for details.
<P>
The original Linux system call was named
<B>sigtimedwait</B>().

However, with the addition of real-time signals in Linux 2.2,
the fixed-size, 32-bit
<I>sigset_t</I>

type supported by that system call was no longer fit for purpose.
Consequently, a new system call,
<B>rt_sigtimedwait</B>(),

was added to support an enlarged
<I>sigset_t</I>

type.
The new system call takes a fourth argument,
<I>size_t sigsetsize</I>,

which specifies the size in bytes of the signal set in
<I>set</I>.

This argument is currently required to have the value
<I>sizeof(sigset_t)</I>

(or the error
<B>EINVAL</B>

results).
The glibc
<B>sigtimedwait</B>()

wrapper function hides these details from us, transparently calling
<B>rt_sigtimedwait</B>()

when the kernel provides it.
