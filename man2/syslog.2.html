</PRE>

<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

If you need the C library function
<B>syslog</B>()

(which talks to
<B><A HREF="../man8/syslogd.8.html">syslogd</A></B>(8)),

then look at
<B><A HREF="../man3/syslog.3.html">syslog</A></B>(3).

The system call of this name is about controlling the kernel
<I>printk</I>()

buffer, and the glibc wrapper function is called
<B>klogctl</B>().

<P>
The <I>type</I> argument determines the action taken by this function,
as follows:
<P>
<PRE>
      0 -- Close the log.  Currently a NOP.
      1 -- Open the log. Currently a NOP.
      2 -- Read from the log.
      3 -- Read all messages remaining in the ring buffer.
      4 -- Read and clear all messages remaining in the ring buffer
      5 -- Clear ring buffer.
      6 -- Disable printk to console
      7 -- Enable printk to console
      8 -- Set level of messages printed to console
      9 -- Return number of unread characters in the log buffer
     10 -- Return size of the log buffer
</PRE>

<P>
Type 9 was added in Linux 2.4.10; type 10 in Linux 2.6.6.
<P>
In Linux kernels before 2.6.37,
only command types 3 and 10 are allowed to unprivileged processes.
Since Linux 2.6.37,
command types 3 and 10 are only allowed to unprivileged processes if
<I>/proc/sys/kernel/dmesg_restrict</I>

has the value 0.
Before Linux 2.6.37, &quot;privileged&quot; means that the caller has the
<B>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</B>

capability.
Since Linux 2.6.37,
&quot;privileged&quot; means that the caller has either the
<B>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</B>

capability (now deprecated for this purpose) or the (new)
<B>CAP_SYSLOG</B>

capability.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>The kernel log buffer</H3>

The kernel has a cyclic buffer of length
<B>LOG_BUF_LEN</B>

in which messages given as arguments to the kernel function
<B>printk</B>()

are stored (regardless of their loglevel).
In early kernels,
<B>LOG_BUF_LEN</B>

had the value 4096;
from kernel 1.3.54, it was 8192;
from kernel 2.1.113 it was 16384;
since 2.4.23/2.6 the value is a kernel configuration option.


In recent kernels the size can be queried with command type 10.
<P>
The call
<I>syslog(2,buf,len)</I>

waits until this kernel log buffer is nonempty, and then reads
at most <I>len</I> bytes into the buffer <I>buf</I>.
It returns
the number of bytes read.
Bytes read from the log disappear from
the log buffer: the information can only be read once.
This is the function executed by the kernel when a user program
reads
<I>/proc/kmsg</I>.

<P>
The call
<I>syslog(3,buf,len)</I>

will read the last <I>len</I> bytes from the log buffer (nondestructively),
but will not read more than was written into the buffer since the
last &quot;clear ring buffer&quot; command (which does not clear the buffer at all).
It returns the number of bytes read.
<P>
The call
<I>syslog(4,buf,len)</I>

does precisely the same, but also executes the &quot;clear ring buffer&quot; command.
<P>
The call
<I>syslog(5,dummy,dummy)</I>

executes just the &quot;clear ring buffer&quot; command.
(In each call where
<I>buf</I>

or
<I>len</I>

is shown as &quot;dummy&quot;, the value of the argument is ignored by the call.)
<P>
The call
<I>syslog(6,dummy,dummy)</I>

sets the console log level to minimum, so that no messages are printed
to the console.
<P>
The call
<I>syslog(7,dummy,dummy)</I>

sets the console log level to default, so that messages are printed
to the console.
<P>
The call
<I>syslog(8,dummy,level)</I>

sets the console log level to
<I>level</I>,

which must be an integer between 1 and 8 (inclusive).
See the
<B>loglevel</B>

section for details.
<P>
The call
<I>syslog(9,dummy,dummy)</I>

returns the number of bytes currently available to be read
on the kernel log buffer.
<P>
The call
<I>syslog(10,dummy,dummy)</I>

returns the total size of the kernel log buffer.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>The loglevel</H3>

The kernel routine
<B>printk</B>()

will only print a message on the
console, if it has a loglevel less than the value of the variable
<I>console_loglevel</I>.

This variable initially has the value
<B>DEFAULT_CONSOLE_LOGLEVEL</B>

(7), but is set to 10 if the
kernel command line contains the word &quot;debug&quot;, and to 15 in case
of a kernel fault (the 10 and 15 are just silly, and equivalent to 8).
This variable is set (to a value in the range 1-8) by the call
<I>syslog(8,dummy,value)</I>.

The calls
<I>syslog(type,dummy,dummy)</I>

with <I>type</I> equal to 6 or 7, set it to 1 (kernel panics only)
or 7 (all except debugging messages), respectively.
<P>
Every text line in a message has its own loglevel.
This level is
<I>DEFAULT_MESSAGE_LOGLEVEL - 1</I>

(6) unless the line starts with &lt;d&gt;
where <I>d</I> is a digit in the range 1-7, in which case the level
is <I>d</I>.
The conventional meaning of the loglevel is defined in
<I>&lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/linux/kernel.h">linux/kernel.h</A>&gt;</I>

as follows:
<P>
<PRE>
#define KERN_EMERG    &quot;&lt;0&gt;&quot;  /* system is unusable               */
#define KERN_ALERT    &quot;&lt;1&gt;&quot;  /* action must be taken immediately */
#define KERN_CRIT     &quot;&lt;2&gt;&quot;  /* critical conditions              */
#define KERN_ERR      &quot;&lt;3&gt;&quot;  /* error conditions                 */
#define KERN_WARNING  &quot;&lt;4&gt;&quot;  /* warning conditions               */
#define KERN_NOTICE   &quot;&lt;5&gt;&quot;  /* normal but significant condition */
#define KERN_INFO     &quot;&lt;6&gt;&quot;  /* informational                    */
#define KERN_DEBUG    &quot;&lt;7&gt;&quot;  /* debug-level messages             */
</PRE>

<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

For <I>type</I> equal to 2, 3, or 4, a successful call to
<B>syslog</B>()

returns the number
of bytes read.
For <I>type</I> 9,
<B>syslog</B>()

returns the number of bytes currently
available to be read on the kernel log buffer.
For <I>type</I> 10,
<B>syslog</B>()

returns the total size of the kernel log buffer.
For other values of <I>type</I>, 0 is returned on success.
<P>
In case of error, -1 is returned,
and <I>errno</I> is set to indicate the error.
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EINVAL</B>

<DD>
Bad arguments (e.g.,
bad
<I>type</I>;

or for
<I>type</I>

2, 3, or 4,
<I>buf</I>

is NULL,
or
<I>len</I>

is less than zero; or for
<I>type</I>

8, the
<I>level</I>

is outside the range 1 to 8).
<DT><B>ENOSYS</B>

<DD>
This
<B>syslog</B>()

system call is not available, because the kernel was compiled with the
<B>CONFIG_PRINTK</B>

kernel-configuration option disabled.
<DT><B>EPERM</B>

<DD>
An attempt was made to change console_loglevel or clear the kernel
message ring buffer by a process without sufficient privilege
(more precisely: without the
<B>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</B>

or
<B>CAP_SYSLOG</B>

capability).
<DT><B>ERESTARTSYS</B>

<DD>
System call was interrupted by a signal; nothing was read.
(This can be seen only during a trace.)
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>CONFORMING TO</H2>

This system call is Linux-specific and should not be used in programs
intended to be portable.
<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NOTES</H2>

From the very start people noted that it is unfortunate that
a system call and a library routine of the same name are entirely
different animals.
In libc4 and libc5 the number of this call was defined by
<B>SYS_klog</B>.

In glibc 2.0 the syscall is baptized
<B>klogctl</B>().
