<H2>NAME</H2>

times - get process times
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>#include &lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/sys/times.h">sys/times.h</A>&gt;</B>

<P>
<B>clock_t times(struct tms *</B><I>buf</I><B>);</B>

<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B>times</B>()

stores the current process times in the
<I>struct tms</I>

that
<I>buf</I>

points to.
The
<I>struct tms</I>

is as defined in
<I>&lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/sys/times.h">sys/times.h</A>&gt;</I>:

<P>

<PRE>
struct tms {
    clock_t tms_utime;  /* user time */
    clock_t tms_stime;  /* system time */
    clock_t tms_cutime; /* user time of children */
    clock_t tms_cstime; /* system time of children */
};
</PRE>


<P>

The
<I>tms_utime</I>

field contains the CPU time spent executing instructions
of the calling process.
The
<I>tms_stime</I>

field contains the CPU time spent in the system while
executing tasks on behalf of the calling process.
The
<I>tms_cutime</I>

field contains the sum of the
<I>tms_utime</I>

and
<I>tms_cutime</I>

values for all waited-for terminated children.
The
<I>tms_cstime</I>

field contains the sum of the
<I>tms_stime</I>

and
<I>tms_cstime</I>

values for all waited-for terminated children.
<P>

Times for terminated children (and their descendants)
are added in at the moment
<B><A HREF="../man2/wait.2.html">wait</A></B>(2)

or
<B><A HREF="../man2/waitpid.2.html">waitpid</A></B>(2)

returns their process ID.
In particular, times of grandchildren
that the children did not wait for are never seen.
<P>

All times reported are in clock ticks.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

<B>times</B>()

returns the number of clock ticks that have elapsed since
an arbitrary point in the past.
The return value may overflow the possible range of type
<I>clock_t</I>.

On error, <I>(clock_t)&nbsp;-1</I> is returned, and
<I>errno</I>

is set appropriately.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EFAULT</B>

<DD>
<I>tms</I>

points outside the process's address space.

<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>CONFORMING TO</H2>

SVr4, 4.3BSD, POSIX.1-2001.
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NOTES</H2>

The number of clock ticks per second can be obtained using:

<P>
sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK);

<P>

In POSIX.1-1996 the symbol <B>CLK_TCK</B> (defined in
<I>&lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/time.h">time.h</A>&gt;</I>)

is mentioned as obsolescent.
It is obsolete now.
<P>

In Linux kernel versions before 2.6.9,
if the disposition of
<B>SIGCHLD</B>

is set to
<B>SIG_IGN</B>,

then the times of terminated children
are automatically included in the
<I>tms_cstime</I>

and
<I>tms_cutime</I>

fields, although POSIX.1-2001 says that this should happen
only if the calling process
<B><A HREF="../man2/wait.2.html">wait</A></B>(2)s

on its children.
This nonconformance is rectified in Linux 2.6.9 and later.



<P>
On Linux, the
<I>buf</I>

argument can be specified as NULL, with the result that
<B>times</B>()

just returns a function result.
However, POSIX does not specify this behavior, and most
other UNIX implementations require a non-NULL value for
<I>buf</I>.

<P>

Note that
<B><A HREF="../man3/clock.3.html">clock</A></B>(3)

also returns a value of type
<I>clock_t</I>,

but this value is measured in units of
<B>CLOCKS_PER_SEC</B>,

not the clock ticks used by
<B>times</B>().

<P>
On Linux, the &quot;arbitrary point in the past&quot; from which the return value of
<B>times</B>()

is measured has varied across kernel versions.
On Linux 2.4 and earlier this point is the moment the system was booted.
Since Linux 2.6, this point is <I>(2^32/HZ) - 300</I>
(i.e., about 429 million) seconds before system boot time.
This variability across kernel versions (and across UNIX implementations),
combined with the fact that the returned value may overflow the range of
<I>clock_t</I>,

means that a portable application would be wise to avoid using this value.
To measure changes in elapsed time, use
<B><A HREF="../man2/clock_gettime.2.html">clock_gettime</A></B>(2)

instead.



<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Historical</H3>

SVr1-3 returns
<I>long</I>

and the struct members are of type
<I>time_t</I>

although they store clock ticks, not seconds since the Epoch.
V7 used
<I>long</I>

for the struct members, because it had no type
<I>time_t</I>

yet.
<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>BUGS</H2>

A limitation of the Linux system call conventions on some architectures
(notably i386) means that on Linux 2.6 there is a small time window
(41 seconds) soon after boot when
<B>times</B>()

can return -1, falsely indicating that an error occurred.
The same problem can occur when the return value wraps past
the maximum value that can be stored in
<B>clock_t</B>.
