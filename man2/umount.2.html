umount, umount2 - unmount file system
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<PRE>
<B>#include &lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/sys/mount.h">sys/mount.h</A>&gt;</B>

<B>int umount(const char *</B><I>target</I><B>);</B>

<B>int umount2(const char *</B><I>target</I><B>, int </B><I>flags</I><B>);</B>
</PRE>

<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B>umount</B>()

and
<B>umount2</B>()

remove the attachment of the (topmost) file system mounted on
<I>target</I>.




<P>
Appropriate privilege (Linux: the
<B>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</B>

capability) is required to unmount file systems.
<P>
Linux 2.1.116 added the
<B>umount2</B>()

system call, which, like
<B>umount</B>(),

unmounts a target, but allows additional
<I>flags</I>

controlling the behavior of the operation:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>MNT_FORCE</B> (since Linux 2.1.116)

<DD>
Force unmount even if busy.
This can cause data loss.
(Only for NFS mounts.)
<DT><B>MNT_DETACH</B> (since Linux 2.4.11)

<DD>
Perform a lazy unmount: make the mount point unavailable for
new accesses, and actually perform the unmount when the mount point
ceases to be busy.
<DT><B>MNT_EXPIRE</B> (since Linux 2.6.8)

<DD>
Mark the mount point as expired.
If a mount point is not currently in use, then an initial call to
<B>umount2</B>()

with this flag fails with the error
<B>EAGAIN</B>,

but marks the mount point as expired.
The mount point remains expired as long as it isn't accessed
by any process.
A second
<B>umount2</B>()

call specifying
<B>MNT_EXPIRE</B>

unmounts an expired mount point.
This flag cannot be specified with either
<B>MNT_FORCE</B>

or
<B>MNT_DETACH</B>.

<DT><B>UMOUNT_NOFOLLOW</B> (since Linux 2.6.34)

<DD>

Don't dereference
<I>target</I>

if it is a symbolic link.
This flag allows security problems to be avoided in set-user-ID-<I>root</I>
programs that allow unprivileged users to unmount file systems.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

On success, zero is returned.
On error, -1 is returned, and
<I>errno</I>

is set appropriately.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

The error values given below result from file-system type independent
errors.
Each file system type may have its own special errors and its
own special behavior.
See the kernel source code for details.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EAGAIN</B>

<DD>
A call to
<B>umount2</B>()

specifying
<B>MNT_EXPIRE</B>

successfully marked an unbusy file system as expired.
<DT><B>EBUSY</B>

<DD>
<I>target</I>

could not be unmounted because it is busy.
<DT><B>EFAULT</B>

<DD>
<I>target</I>

points outside the user address space.
<DT><B>EINVAL</B>

<DD>
<I>target</I>

is not a mount point.
Or,
<B>umount2</B>()

was called with
<B>MNT_EXPIRE</B>

and either
<B>MNT_DETACH</B>

or
<B>MNT_FORCE</B>.

<DT><B>ENAMETOOLONG</B>

<DD>
A pathname was longer than
<B>MAXPATHLEN</B>.

<DT><B>ENOENT</B>

<DD>
A pathname was empty or had a nonexistent component.
<DT><B>ENOMEM</B>

<DD>
The kernel could not allocate a free page to copy filenames or data into.
<DT><B>EPERM</B>

<DD>
The caller does not have the required privileges.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>VERSIONS</H2>

<B>MNT_DETACH</B>

and
<B>MNT_EXPIRE</B>


are only available in glibc since version 2.11.
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>CONFORMING TO</H2>

These functions are Linux-specific and should not be used in
programs intended to be portable.
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NOTES</H2>

The original
<B>umount</B>()

function was called as <I>umount(device)</I> and would return
<B>ENOTBLK</B>

when called with something other than a block device.
In Linux 0.98p4 a call <I>umount(dir)</I> was added, in order to
support anonymous devices.
In Linux 2.3.99-pre7 the call <I>umount(device)</I> was removed,
leaving only <I>umount(dir)</I> (since now devices can be mounted
in more than one place, so specifying the device does not suffice).
