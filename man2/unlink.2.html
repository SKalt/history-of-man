Section: Linux Programmer's Manual (2)<BR>Updated: 2011-09-15<BR><A HREF="#index">Index</A>

<A NAME="lbAB">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NAME</H2>

unlink - delete a name and possibly the file it refers to
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>#include &lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/unistd.h">unistd.h</A>&gt;</B>

<P>
<B>int unlink(const char *</B><I>pathname</I><B>);</B>

<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B>unlink</B>()

deletes a name from the file system.
If that name was the
last link to a file and no processes have the file open the file is
deleted and the space it was using is made available for reuse.
<P>
If the name was the last link to a file but any processes still have
the file open the file will remain in existence until the last file
descriptor referring to it is closed.
<P>
If the name referred to a symbolic link the link is removed.
<P>
If the name referred to a socket, fifo or device the name for it is
removed but processes which have the object open may continue to use
it.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

On success, zero is returned.
On error, -1 is returned, and
<I>errno</I>

is set appropriately.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EACCES</B>

<DD>
Write access to the directory containing
<I>pathname</I>

is not allowed for the process's effective UID, or one of the
directories in
<I>pathname</I>

did not allow search permission.
(See also
<B><A HREF="../man7/path_resolution.7.html">path_resolution</A></B>(7).)

<DT><B>EBUSY</B>

<DD>
The file
<I>pathname</I>

cannot be unlinked because it is being used by the system
or another process;
for example, it is a mount point
or the NFS client software created it to represent an
active but otherwise nameless inode (&quot;NFS silly renamed&quot;).
<DT><B>EFAULT</B>

<DD>
<I>pathname</I>

points outside your accessible address space.
<DT><B>EIO</B>

<DD>
An I/O error occurred.
<DT><B>EISDIR</B>

<DD>
<I>pathname</I>

refers to a directory.
(This is the non-POSIX value returned by Linux since 2.1.132.)
<DT><B>ELOOP</B>

<DD>
Too many symbolic links were encountered in translating
<I>pathname</I>.

<DT><B>ENAMETOOLONG</B>

<DD>
<I>pathname</I> was too long.

<DT><B>ENOENT</B>

<DD>
A component in
<I>pathname</I>

does not exist or is a dangling symbolic link, or
<I>pathname</I>

is empty.
<DT><B>ENOMEM</B>

<DD>
Insufficient kernel memory was available.
<DT><B>ENOTDIR</B>

<DD>
A component used as a directory in
<I>pathname</I>

is not, in fact, a directory.
<DT><B>EPERM</B>

<DD>
The system does not allow unlinking of directories,
or unlinking of directories requires privileges that the
calling process doesn't have.
(This is the POSIX prescribed error return;
as noted above, Linux returns
<B>EISDIR</B>

for this case.)
<DT><B>EPERM</B> (Linux only)

<DD>
The file system does not allow unlinking of files.
<DT><B>EPERM</B> or <B>EACCES</B>

<DD>
The directory containing
<I>pathname</I>

has the sticky bit
(<B>S_ISVTX</B>)

set and the process's effective UID is neither the UID of the file to
be deleted nor that of the directory containing it, and
the process is not privileged (Linux: does not have the
<B>CAP_FOWNER</B>

capability).
<DT><B>EROFS</B>

<DD>
<I>pathname</I>

refers to a file on a read-only file system.

<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>BUGS</H2>

Infelicities in the protocol underlying NFS can cause the unexpected
disappearance of files which are still being used.
