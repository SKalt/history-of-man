<B>int uselib(const char *</B><I>library</I><B>);</B>

<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The system call
<B>uselib</B>()

serves to load
a shared library to be used by the calling process.
It is given a pathname.
The address where to load is found
in the library itself.
The library can have any recognized
binary format.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

On success, zero is returned.
On error, -1 is returned, and
<I>errno</I>

is set appropriately.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

In addition to all of the error codes returned by
<B><A HREF="../man2/open.2.html">open</A></B>(2)

and
<B><A HREF="../man2/mmap.2.html">mmap</A></B>(2),

the following may also be returned:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EACCES</B>

<DD>
The library specified by
<I>library</I>

does not have read or execute permission, or the caller does not have
search permission for one of the directories in the path prefix.
(See also
<B><A HREF="../man7/path_resolution.7.html">path_resolution</A></B>(7).)

<DT><B>ENFILE</B>

<DD>
The system limit on the total number of open files has been reached.
<DT><B>ENOEXEC</B>

<DD>
The file specified by
<I>library</I>

is not an executable of a known type;
for example, it does not have the correct magic numbers.

<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>CONFORMING TO</H2>

<B>uselib</B>()

is Linux-specific, and should not be used in programs
intended to be portable.
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NOTES</H2>

<B>uselib</B>()

was used by early libc startup code to load
the shared libraries with names found in an array of names
in the binary.
<P>


Since libc 4.3.2, startup code tries to prefix these names
with &quot;/usr/lib&quot;, &quot;/lib&quot; and &quot;&quot; before giving up.

In libc 4.3.4 and later these names are looked for in the directories
found in
<B>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</B>,

and if not found there,
prefixes &quot;/usr/lib&quot;, &quot;/lib&quot; and &quot;/&quot; are tried.
<P>

From libc 4.4.4 on only the library &quot;/lib/ld.so&quot; is loaded,
so that this dynamic library can load the remaining libraries needed
(again using this call).
This is also the state of affairs in libc5.
<P>

glibc2 does not use this call.
