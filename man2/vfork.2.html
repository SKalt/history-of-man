vfork - create a child process and block parent

<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>STANDARD DESCRIPTION</H2>

(From SUSv2 / POSIX draft.)
The
<B>vfork</B>()

function has the same effect as
<B>fork</B>(),

except that the behaviour is undefined if the process created by
<B>vfork</B>()

either modifies any data other than a variable of type
<I>pid_t</I>

used to store the return value from
<B>vfork</B>(),

or returns from the function in which
<B>vfork</B>()

was called, or calls any other function before successfully calling
<B>_exit</B>()

or one of the
<B>exec</B>()

family of functions.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>LINUX DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B>vfork</B>(),

just like
<B><A HREF="../man2/fork.2.html">fork</A></B>(2),

creates a child process of the calling process.
For details and return value and errors, see
<B><A HREF="../man2/fork.2.html">fork</A></B>(2).

<P>

<B>vfork</B>()

is a special case of
<B><A HREF="../man2/clone.2.html">clone</A></B>(2).

It is used to create new processes without copying the page tables of
the parent process.
It may be useful in performance sensitive applications
where a child will be created which then immediately issues an
<B>execve</B>()<B>.</B>

<P>

<B>vfork</B>()

differs from
<B>fork</B>()

in that the parent is suspended until the child makes a call to
<B><A HREF="../man2/execve.2.html">execve</A></B>(2)

or
<B><A HREF="../man2/_exit.2.html">_exit</A></B>(2).

The child shares all memory with its parent, including the stack, until
<B>execve</B>()

is issued by the child.
The child must not return from the current function or call
<B>exit</B>(),

but may call
<B>_exit</B>().

<P>

Signal handlers are inherited, but not shared.
Signals to the parent
arrive after the child releases the parent's memory.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>HISTORIC DESCRIPTION</H2>

Under Linux,
<B>fork</B>()

is implemented using copy-on-write pages, so the only penalty incurred by
<B>fork</B>()

is the time and memory required to duplicate the parent's page tables,
and to create a unique task structure for the child.
However, in the bad old days a
<B>fork</B>()

would require making a complete copy of the caller's data space,
often needlessly, since usually immediately afterwards an
<B>exec</B>()

is done.
Thus, for greater efficiency, BSD introduced the
<B>vfork</B>()

system call, that did not fully copy the address space of
the parent process, but borrowed the parent's memory and thread
of control until a call to
<B>execve</B>()

or an exit occurred.
The parent process was suspended while the
child was using its resources.
The use of
<B>vfork</B>()

was tricky: for example, not modifying data
in the parent process depended on knowing which variables are
held in a register.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>BUGS</H2>

It is rather unfortunate that Linux revived this spectre from the past.
The BSD manpage states:
&quot;This system call will be eliminated when proper system sharing mechanisms
are implemented.
Users should not depend on the memory sharing semantics of
<B>vfork</B>()

as it will, in that case, be made synonymous to
<B>fork</B>().&quot;
<P>
Details of the signal handling are obscure and differ between systems.
The BSD manpage states:
&quot;To avoid a possible deadlock situation, processes that are children
in the middle of a
<B>vfork</B>()

are never sent SIGTTOU or SIGTTIN signals; rather, output or
<I>ioctl</I>s

are allowed and input attempts result in an end-of-file indication.&quot;







<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>HISTORY</H2>

The
<B>vfork</B>()

system call appeared in 3.0BSD.


In 4.4BSD it was made synonymous to
<B>fork</B>()

but NetBSD introduced it again,
cf. <A HREF="http://www.netbsd.org/Documentation/kernel/vfork.html">http://www.netbsd.org/Documentation/kernel/vfork.html</A> .
In Linux, it has been equivalent to
<B>fork</B>()

until 2.2.0-pre6 or so.
Since 2.2.0-pre9 (on i386, somewhat later on
other architectures) it is an independent system call.
Support was added in glibc 2.0.112.
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>CONFORMING TO</H2>

4.3BSD, POSIX.1-2001.


The requirements put on
<B>vfork</B>()

by the standards are weaker than those put on
<B>fork</B>(),

so an implementation where the two are synonymous is compliant.
In particular, the programmer cannot
rely on the parent remaining blocked until a call of
<B>execve</B>()

or
<B>_exit</B>()

and cannot rely on any specific behaviour w.r.t. shared memory.

<H2>LINUX NOTES</H2>

Fork handlers established using
<B><A HREF="../man3/pthread_atfork.3.html">pthread_atfork</A></B>(3)

are not called when a multithreaded program employing
the NPTL threading library calls
<B>vfork</B>().

Fork handlers are called in this case in a program using the
LinuxThreads threading library.
(See
<B><A HREF="../man7/pthreads.7.html">pthreads</A></B>(7)

for a description of Linux threading libraries.)
