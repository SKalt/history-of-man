<P>
<B>int vm86old(struct vm86_struct *</B><I>info</I><B>);</B>

<P>
<B>int vm86(unsigned long </B><I>fn</I><B>, struct vm86plus_struct *</B><I>v86</I><B>);</B>

<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The system call
<B>vm86</B>()

was introduced in Linux 0.97p2.
In Linux 2.1.15 and 2.0.28, it was renamed to
<B>vm86old</B>(),

and a new
<B>vm86</B>()

was introduced.
The definition of
<I>struct vm86_struct</I>

was changed
in 1.1.8 and 1.1.9.
<P>

These calls cause the process to enter VM86 mode (virtual-8086 in Intel
literature), and are used by
<B>dosemu</B>.

<P>

VM86 mode is an emulation of real mode within a protected mode task.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

On success, zero is returned.
On error, -1 is returned, and
<I>errno</I>

is set appropriately.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EFAULT</B>

<DD>
This return value is specific to i386 and indicates a problem with getting
user-space data.
<DT><B>ENOSYS</B>

<DD>
This return value indicates the call is not implemented on the present
architecture.
<DT><B>EPERM</B>

<DD>
Saved kernel stack exists.
(This is a kernel sanity check; the saved
stack should exist only within vm86 mode itself.)
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>CONFORMING TO</H2>

This call is specific to Linux on 32-bit Intel processors,
and should not be used in programs intended to be portable.
