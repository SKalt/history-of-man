<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The
<B>wait</B>

function suspends execution of the current process until a child has
exited, or until a signal is delivered whose action is to terminate
the current process or to call a signal handling function.  If a child
has already exited by the time of the call (a so-called &quot;zombie&quot;
process), the function returns immediately.  Any system resources used
by the child are freed.
<P>
The
<B>waitpid</B>

function suspends execution of the current process until a
child as specified by the
<I>pid</I>

argument has exited, or until a signal is delivered whose action is to
terminate the current process or to call a signal handling function.
If a child as requested by
<I>pid</I>

has already exited by the time of the call (a so-called &quot;zombie&quot;
process), the function returns immediately.  Any system resources used
by the child are freed.
<P>
The value of
<I>pid</I>

can be one of:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>&lt; -1<DD>
which means to wait for any child process whose process group ID is
equal to the absolute value of
<I>pid</I>.

<DT>-1<DD>
which means to wait for any child process; this is the same
behaviour which
<B>wait</B>

exhibits.
<DT>0<DD>
which means to wait for any child process whose process group ID is
equal to that of the calling process.
<DT>&gt; 0<DD>
which means to wait for the child whose process ID is equal to the
value of
<I>pid</I>.

</DL>
<P>

The value of
<I>options</I>

is an OR of zero or more of the following constants:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>WNOHANG</B>

<DD>
which means to return immediately if no child has exited.
<DT><B>WUNTRACED</B>

<DD>
which means to also return for children which are stopped
(but not traced), and whose status has not been reported.
Status for traced children which are stopped is provided
also without this option.
</DL>
<P>

(For Linux-only options, see below.)
<P>

If
<I>status</I>

is not
<B>NULL</B>,

<B>wait</B>

or
<B>waitpid</B>

store status information in the location pointed to by
<I>status</I>.

<P>
This status can be evaluated with the following macros (these macros take
the stat buffer (an <B>int</B>) as an argument --- not a pointer to the
buffer!):
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>WIFEXITED(</B><I>status</I><B>)</B>

<DD>
returns true if the child terminated normally, that is,
by calling exit() or _exit(), or by returning from main().
<DT><B>WEXITSTATUS(</B><I>status</I><B>)</B>

<DD>
evaluates to the least significant eight bits of the return code of
the child which terminated, which may have been set as the argument to
a call to exit() or _exit() or as the argument for a return statement
in the main program.  This macro can only be evaluated if
<B>WIFEXITED</B>

returned true.
<DT><B>WIFSIGNALED(</B><I>status</I><B>)</B>

<DD>
returns true if the child process terminated because of a signal
which was not caught.
<DT><B>WTERMSIG(</B><I>status</I><B>)</B>

<DD>
returns the number of the signal that caused the child process to
terminate. This macro can only be evaluated if
<B>WIFSIGNALED</B>

returned non-zero.
<DT><B>WIFSTOPPED(</B><I>status</I><B>)</B>

<DD>
returns true if the child process which caused the return is currently
stopped; this is only possible if the call was done using
<B>WUNTRACED</B>

or when the child is being traced (see
<B><A HREF="../man2/ptrace.2.html">ptrace</A></B>(2)).

<DT><B>WSTOPSIG(</B><I>status</I><B>)</B>

<DD>
returns the number of the signal which caused the child to stop.  This
macro can only be evaluated if
<B>WIFSTOPPED</B>

returned non-zero.
</DL>
<P>

Some versions of Unix (e.g. Linux, Solaris, but not AIX, SunOS)
also define a macro
<B>WCOREDUMP(</B><I>status</I><B>)</B>

to test whether the child process dumped core. Only use this
enclosed in #ifdef WCOREDUMP ... #endif.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

The process ID of the child which exited, or zero if
<B>WNOHANG</B>

was used and no child was available, or -1 on error (in which case
<I>errno</I>

is set to an appropriate value).
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>ECHILD</B> (for <B>wait</B>)

<DD>
The calling process does not have any unwaited-for children.
<DT><B>ECHILD</B> (for <B>waitpid</B>)

<DD>
The process specified in
<I>pid</I>

does not exist or is not a child of the calling process.
(This can happen for one's own child if the action for SIGCHLD
is set to SIG_IGN. See also the LINUX NOTES section about threads.)
<DT><B>EINTR</B>

<DD>
<B>WNOHANG</B>

was not set and an unblocked signal or a
<B>SIGCHLD</B>

was caught.
<DT><B>EINVAL</B>

<DD>
The
<I>options</I>

argument was invalid.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NOTES</H2>

The Single Unix Specification describes a flag SA_NOCLDWAIT (not supported
under Linux) such that if either this flag is set, or the action for
SIGCHLD is set to SIG_IGN
then children that exit do not become zombies and a call to
<B>wait</B>()

or
<B>waitpid</B>()

will block until all children have exited, and then fail with
<I>errno</I>

set to ECHILD.
<P>

The original POSIX standard left the behaviour of setting SIGCHLD to
SIG_IGN unspecified.
Later standards, including SUSv2 and POSIX 1003.1-2001 specify the
behaviour just described as an XSI-compliance option.
Linux does not conform to the second of the two points just described:
if a
<B>wait</B>() or <B>waitpid</B>()

call is made while SIGCHLD is being ignored,
the call behaves just as though SIGCHLD were not being igored, that is,
the call blocks until the next child terminates and then returns the
PID and status of that child.
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>LINUX NOTES</H2>

In the Linux kernel, a kernel-scheduled thread is not a distinct
construct from a process. Instead, a thread is simply a process
that is created using the Linux-unique
<B><A HREF="../man2/clone.2.html">clone</A></B>(2)

system call; other routines such as the portable
<B><A HREF="../man3/pthread_create.3.html">pthread_create</A></B>(3)

call are implemented using
<B><A HREF="../man2/clone.2.html">clone</A></B>(2).

Before Linux 2.4, a thread was just a special case of a process,
and as a consequence one thread could not wait on the children
of another thread, even when the latter belongs to the same thread group.
However, POSIX prescribes such functionality, and since Linux 2.4
a thread can, and by default will, wait on children of other threads
in the same thread group.
<P>

The following Linux-specific
<I>options</I>

are for use with children created using
<B><A HREF="../man2/clone.2.html">clone</A></B>(2).

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>__WCLONE</B>

<DD>

Wait for &quot;clone&quot; children only.  If omitted then wait
for &quot;non-clone&quot; children only.  (A &quot;clone&quot; child is one
which delivers no signal, or a signal other than
<B>SIGCHLD</B>

to its parent upon termination.)
This option is ignored if
<B>__WALL</B>

is also specified.
<DT><B>__WALL</B>

<DD>

(Since Linux 2.4) Wait for all children, regardless of
type (&quot;clone&quot; or &quot;non-clone&quot;).
<DT><B>__WNOTHREAD</B>

<DD>

(Since Linux 2.4) Do not wait for children of other threads in
the same thread group. This was the default before Linux 2.4.
