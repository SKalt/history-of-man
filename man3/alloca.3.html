<H2>NAME</H2>

alloca - allocate memory that is automatically freed
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>#include &lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/alloca.h">alloca.h</A>&gt;</B>

<P>
<B>void *alloca(size_t </B><I>size</I><B>);</B>

<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The
<B>alloca</B>()

function allocates
<I>size</I>

bytes of space in the stack frame of the caller.
This temporary space is
automatically freed when the function that called
<B>alloca</B>()

returns to its caller.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

The
<B>alloca</B>()

function returns a pointer to the beginning of the allocated space.
If the allocation causes stack overflow, program behavior is undefined.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ATTRIBUTES</H2>

<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Multithreading (see <A HREF="../man7/pthreads.7.html">pthreads</A>(7))</H3>

The
<B>alloca</B>()

function is thread-safe.
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>CONFORMING TO</H2>

This function is not in POSIX.1-2001.
<P>
There is evidence that the
<B>alloca</B>()

function appeared in 32V, PWB, PWB.2, 3BSD, and 4BSD.
There is a man page for it in 4.3BSD.
Linux uses the GNU version.
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NOTES</H2>

The
<B>alloca</B>()

function is machine- and compiler-dependent.
For certain applications,
its use can improve efficiency compared to the use of
<B><A HREF="../man3/malloc.3.html">malloc</A></B>(3)

plus
<B><A HREF="../man3/free.3.html">free</A></B>(3).

In certain cases,
it can also simplify memory deallocation in applications that use
<B><A HREF="../man3/longjmp.3.html">longjmp</A></B>(3)

or
<B><A HREF="../man3/siglongjmp.3.html">siglongjmp</A></B>(3).

Otherwise, its use is discouraged.
<P>
Because the space allocated by
<B>alloca</B>()

is allocated within the stack frame,
that space is automatically freed if the function return
is jumped over by a call to
<B><A HREF="../man3/longjmp.3.html">longjmp</A></B>(3)

or
<B><A HREF="../man3/siglongjmp.3.html">siglongjmp</A></B>(3).

<P>
Do not attempt to
<B><A HREF="../man3/free.3.html">free</A></B>(3)

space allocated by
<B>alloca</B>()!

<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Notes on the GNU version</H3>

Normally,
<B><A HREF="../man1/gcc.1.html">gcc</A></B>(1)

translates calls to
<B>alloca</B>()

with inlined code.
This is not done when either the
<I>-ansi</I>,

<I>-std=c89</I>,

<I>-std=c99</I>,

or the
<I>-std=c11</I>

option is given
<B>and</B>

the header
<I>&lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/alloca.h">alloca.h</A>&gt;</I>

is not included.
Otherwise, (without an -ansi or -std=c* option) the glibc version of
<I>&lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/stdlib.h">stdlib.h</A>&gt;</I>

includes
<I>&lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/alloca.h">alloca.h</A>&gt;</I>

and that contains the lines:
<PRE>

    #ifdef  __GNUC__
    #define alloca(size)   __builtin_alloca (size)
    #endif

</PRE>

with messy consequences if one has a private version of this function.
<P>

The fact that the code is inlined means that it is impossible
to take the address of this function, or to change its behavior
by linking with a different library.
<P>

The inlined code often consists of a single instruction adjusting
the stack pointer, and does not check for stack overflow.
Thus, there is no NULL error return.
<A NAME="lbAK">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>BUGS</H2>

There is no error indication if the stack frame cannot be extended.
(However, after a failed allocation, the program is likely to receive a
<B>SIGSEGV</B>

signal if it attempts to access the unallocated space.)
<P>
On many systems
<B>alloca</B>()

cannot be used inside the list of arguments of a function call, because
the stack space reserved by
<B>alloca</B>()

would appear on the stack in the middle of the space for the
function arguments.
