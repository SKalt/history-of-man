<H2>NAME</H2>

clock - determine processor time
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<PRE>
<B>#include &lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/time.h">time.h</A>&gt;</B>

<B>clock_t clock(void);</B>
</PRE>

<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The
<B>clock</B>()

function returns an approximation of processor time used by the program.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

The value returned is the CPU time used so far as a
<I>clock_t</I>;

to get the number of seconds used, divide by
<B>CLOCKS_PER_SEC</B>.

If the processor time used is not available or its value cannot
be represented, the function returns the value
<I>(clock_t)&nbsp;-1</I>.

<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>CONFORMING TO</H2>

C89, C99, POSIX.1-2001.
POSIX requires that
<B>CLOCKS_PER_SEC</B>

equals 1000000 independent
of the actual resolution.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NOTES</H2>

The C standard allows for arbitrary values at the start of the program;
subtract the value returned from a call to
<B>clock</B>()

at the start of the program to get maximum portability.
<P>

Note that the time can wrap around.
On a 32-bit system where
<B>CLOCKS_PER_SEC</B>

equals 1000000 this function will return the same
value approximately every 72 minutes.
<P>

On several other implementations,
the value returned by
<B>clock</B>()

also includes the times of any children whose status has been
collected via
<B><A HREF="../man2/wait.2.html">wait</A></B>(2)

(or another wait-type call).
Linux does not include the times of waited-for children in the
value returned by
<B>clock</B>().





The
<B><A HREF="../man2/times.2.html">times</A></B>(2)

function, which explicitly returns (separate) information about the
caller and its children, may be preferable.
<P>
In glibc 2.17 and earlier,
<B>clock</B>()

was implemented on top of
<B><A HREF="../man2/times.2.html">times</A></B>(2).

For improved precision,
since glibc 2.18, it is implemented on top of
<B><A HREF="../man2/clock_gettime.2.html">clock_gettime</A></B>(2)

(using the
<B>CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID</B>

clock).
