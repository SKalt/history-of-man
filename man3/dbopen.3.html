<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<I>Note well</I>:

This page documents interfaces provided in glibc up until version 2.1.
Since version 2.2, glibc no longer provides these interfaces.
Probably, you are looking for the APIs provided by the
<I>libdb</I>

library instead.
<P>

<B>dbopen</B>()

is the library interface to database files.
The supported file formats are btree, hashed and UNIX file oriented.
The btree format is a representation of a sorted, balanced tree structure.
The hashed format is an extensible, dynamic hashing scheme.
The flat-file format is a byte stream file with fixed or variable length
records.
The formats and file-format-specific information are described in detail
in their respective manual pages
<B><A HREF="../man3/btree.3.html">btree</A></B>(3),

<B><A HREF="../man3/hash.3.html">hash</A></B>(3),

and
<B><A HREF="../man3/recno.3.html">recno</A></B>(3).

<P>

<B>dbopen</B>()

opens
<I>file</I>

for reading and/or writing.
Files never intended to be preserved on disk may be created by setting
the
<I>file</I>

argument to NULL.
<P>

The
<I>flags</I>

and
<I>mode</I>

arguments are as specified to the
<B><A HREF="../man2/open.2.html">open</A></B>(2)

routine, however, only the
<B>O_CREAT</B>,

<B>O_EXCL</B>,

<B>O_EXLOCK</B>,

<B>O_NONBLOCK</B>,

<B>O_RDONLY</B>,

<B>O_RDWR</B>,

<B>O_SHLOCK</B>,

and
<B>O_TRUNC</B>

flags are meaningful.
(Note, opening a database file
<B>O_WRONLY</B>

is not possible.)



















<P>

The
<I>type</I>

argument is of type
<I>DBTYPE</I>

(as defined in the
<I>&lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/db.h">db.h</A>&gt;</I>

include file) and
may be set to
<B>DB_BTREE</B>,

<B>DB_HASH</B>,

or
<B>DB_RECNO</B>.

<P>

The
<I>openinfo</I>

argument is a pointer to an access-method-specific structure described
in the access method's manual page.
If
<I>openinfo</I>

is NULL, each access method will use defaults appropriate for the system
and the access method.
<P>

<B>dbopen</B>()

returns a pointer to a
<I>DB</I>

structure on success and NULL on error.
The
<I>DB</I>

structure is defined in the
<I>&lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/db.h">db.h</A>&gt;</I>

include file, and contains at
least the following fields:
<P>



typedef struct {
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DBTYPE&nbsp;type;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int&nbsp;(*close)(const&nbsp;DB&nbsp;*db);
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int&nbsp;(*del)(const&nbsp;DB&nbsp;*db,&nbsp;const&nbsp;DBT&nbsp;*key,&nbsp;unsigned&nbsp;int&nbsp;flags);
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int&nbsp;(*fd)(const&nbsp;DB&nbsp;*db);
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int&nbsp;(*get)(const&nbsp;DB&nbsp;*db,&nbsp;DBT&nbsp;*key,&nbsp;DBT&nbsp;*data,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unsigned&nbsp;int&nbsp;flags);
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int&nbsp;(*put)(const&nbsp;DB&nbsp;*db,&nbsp;DBT&nbsp;*key,&nbsp;const&nbsp;DBT&nbsp;*data,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unsigned&nbsp;int&nbsp;flags);
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int&nbsp;(*sync)(const&nbsp;DB&nbsp;*db,&nbsp;unsigned&nbsp;int&nbsp;flags);
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int&nbsp;(*seq)(const&nbsp;DB&nbsp;*db,&nbsp;DBT&nbsp;*key,&nbsp;DBT&nbsp;*data,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unsigned&nbsp;int&nbsp;flags);
} DB;


<P>

These elements describe a database type and a set of functions performing
various actions.
These functions take a pointer to a structure as returned by
<B>dbopen</B>(),

and sometimes one or more pointers to key/data structures and a flag value.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><I>type</I>

<DD>
The type of the underlying access method (and file format).
<DT><I>close</I>

<DD>
A pointer to a routine to flush any cached information to disk, free any
allocated resources, and close the underlying file(s).
Since key/data pairs may be cached in memory, failing to sync the file
with a
<I>close</I>

or
<I>sync</I>

function may result in inconsistent or lost information.
<I>close</I>

routines return -1 on error (setting
<I>errno</I>)

and 0 on success.
<DT><I>del</I>

<DD>
A pointer to a routine to remove key/data pairs from the database.
<DT><DD>
The argument
<I>flag</I>

may be set to the following value:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>R_CURSOR</B>

<DD>
Delete the record referenced by the cursor.
The cursor must have previously been initialized.
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
<I>delete</I>

routines return -1 on error (setting
<I>errno</I>),

0 on success, and 1 if the specified
<I>key</I>

was not in the file.
<DT><I>fd</I>

<DD>
A pointer to a routine which returns a file descriptor representative
of the underlying database.
A file descriptor referencing the same file will be returned to all
processes which call
<B>dbopen</B>()

with the same
<I>file</I>

name.
This file descriptor may be safely used as an argument to the
<B><A HREF="../man2/fcntl.2.html">fcntl</A></B>(2)

and
<B><A HREF="../man2/flock.2.html">flock</A></B>(2)

locking functions.
The file descriptor is not necessarily associated with any of the
underlying files used by the access method.
No file descriptor is available for in memory databases.
<I>fd</I>

routines return -1 on error (setting
<I>errno</I>),

and the file descriptor on success.
<DT><I>get</I>

<DD>
A pointer to a routine which is the interface for keyed retrieval from
the database.
The address and length of the data associated with the specified
<I>key</I>

are returned in the structure referenced by
<I>data</I>.

<I>get</I>

routines return -1 on error (setting
<I>errno</I>),

0 on success, and 1 if the
<I>key</I>

was not in the file.
<DT><I>put</I>

<DD>
A pointer to a routine to store key/data pairs in the database.
<DT><DD>
The argument
<I>flag</I>

may be set to one of the following values:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>R_CURSOR</B>

<DD>
Replace the key/data pair referenced by the cursor.
The cursor must have previously been initialized.
<DT><B>R_IAFTER</B>

<DD>
Append the data immediately after the data referenced by
<I>key</I>,

creating a new key/data pair.
The record number of the appended key/data pair is returned in the
<I>key</I>

structure.
(Applicable only to the
<B>DB_RECNO</B>

access method.)
<DT><B>R_IBEFORE</B>

<DD>
Insert the data immediately before the data referenced by
<I>key</I>,

creating a new key/data pair.
The record number of the inserted key/data pair is returned in the
<I>key</I>

structure.
(Applicable only to the
<B>DB_RECNO</B>

access method.)
<DT><B>R_NOOVERWRITE</B>

<DD>
Enter the new key/data pair only if the key does not previously exist.
<DT><B>R_SETCURSOR</B>

<DD>
Store the key/data pair, setting or initializing the position of the
cursor to reference it.
(Applicable only to the
<B>DB_BTREE</B>

and
<B>DB_RECNO</B>

access methods.)
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
<B>R_SETCURSOR</B>

is available only for the
<B>DB_BTREE</B>

and
<B>DB_RECNO</B>

access
methods because it implies that the keys have an inherent order
which does not change.
<DT><DD>
<B>R_IAFTER</B>

and
<B>R_IBEFORE</B>

are available only for the
<B>DB_RECNO</B>

access method because they each imply that the access method is able to
create new keys.
This is true only if the keys are ordered and independent, record numbers
for example.
<DT><DD>
The default behavior of the
<I>put</I>

routines is to enter the new key/data pair, replacing any previously
existing key.
<DT><DD>
<I>put</I>

routines return -1 on error (setting
<I>errno</I>),

0 on success, and 1 if the
<B>R_NOOVERWRITE</B>

<I>flag</I>

was set and the key already exists in the file.
<DT><I>seq</I>

<DD>
A pointer to a routine which is the interface for sequential
retrieval from the database.
The address and length of the key are returned in the structure
referenced by
<I>key</I>,

and the address and length of the data are returned in the
structure referenced
by
<I>data</I>.

<DT><DD>
Sequential key/data pair retrieval may begin at any time, and the
position of the &quot;cursor&quot; is not affected by calls to the
<I>del</I>,

<I>get</I>,

<I>put</I>,

or
<I>sync</I>

routines.
Modifications to the database during a sequential scan will be reflected
in the scan, that is,
records inserted behind the cursor will not be returned
while records inserted in front of the cursor will be returned.
<DT><DD>
The flag value
<B>must</B>

be set to one of the following values:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>R_CURSOR</B>

<DD>
The data associated with the specified key is returned.
This differs from the
<I>get</I>

routines in that it sets or initializes the cursor to the location of
the key as well.
(Note, for the
<B>DB_BTREE</B>

access method, the returned key is not necessarily an
exact match for the specified key.
The returned key is the smallest key greater than or equal to the specified
key, permitting partial key matches and range searches.)
<DT><B>R_FIRST</B>

<DD>
The first key/data pair of the database is returned, and the cursor
is set or initialized to reference it.
<DT><B>R_LAST</B>

<DD>
The last key/data pair of the database is returned, and the cursor
is set or initialized to reference it.
(Applicable only to the
<B>DB_BTREE</B>

and
<B>DB_RECNO</B>

access methods.)
<DT><B>R_NEXT</B>

<DD>
Retrieve the key/data pair immediately after the cursor.
If the cursor is not yet set, this is the same as the
<B>R_FIRST</B>

flag.
<DT><B>R_PREV</B>

<DD>
Retrieve the key/data pair immediately before the cursor.
If the cursor is not yet set, this is the same as the
<B>R_LAST</B>

flag.
(Applicable only to the
<B>DB_BTREE</B>

and
<B>DB_RECNO</B>

access methods.)
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
<B>R_LAST</B>

and
<B>R_PREV</B>

are available only for the
<B>DB_BTREE</B>

and
<B>DB_RECNO</B>

access methods because they each imply that the keys have an inherent
order which does not change.
<DT><DD>
<I>seq</I>

routines return -1 on error (setting
<I>errno</I>),

0 on success and 1 if there are no key/data pairs less than or greater
than the specified or current key.
If the
<B>DB_RECNO</B>

access method is being used, and if the database file
is a character special file and no complete key/data pairs are currently
available, the
<I>seq</I>

routines return 2.
<DT><I>sync</I>

<DD>
A pointer to a routine to flush any cached information to disk.
If the database is in memory only, the
<I>sync</I>

routine has no effect and will always succeed.
<DT><DD>
The flag value may be set to the following value:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>R_RECNOSYNC</B>

<DD>
If the
<B>DB_RECNO</B>

access method is being used, this flag causes
the sync routine to apply to the btree file which underlies the
recno file, not the recno file itself.
(See the
<I>bfname</I>

field of the
<B><A HREF="../man3/recno.3.html">recno</A></B>(3)

manual page for more information.)
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
<I>sync</I>

routines return -1 on error (setting
<I>errno</I>)

and 0 on success.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Key/data pairs</H3>

Access to all file types is based on key/data pairs.
Both keys and data are represented by the following data structure:
<P>



typedef struct {
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;void&nbsp;&nbsp;*data;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;size_t&nbsp;size;
} DBT;


<P>

The elements of the
<I>DBT</I>

structure are defined as follows:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><I>data</I>

<DD>
A pointer to a byte string.
<DT><I>size</I>

<DD>
The length of the byte string.
</DL>
<P>

Key and data byte strings may reference strings of essentially unlimited
length although any two of them must fit into available memory at the same
time.
It should be noted that the access methods provide no guarantees about
byte string alignment.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

The
<B>dbopen</B>()

routine may fail and set
<I>errno</I>

for any of the errors specified for the library routines
<B><A HREF="../man2/open.2.html">open</A></B>(2)

and
<B><A HREF="../man3/malloc.3.html">malloc</A></B>(3)

or the following:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EFTYPE</B>

<DD>
A file is incorrectly formatted.
<DT><B>EINVAL</B>

<DD>
A parameter has been specified (hash function, pad byte, etc.) that is
incompatible with the current file specification or which is not
meaningful for the function (for example, use of the cursor without
prior initialization) or there is a mismatch between the version
number of file and the software.
</DL>
<P>

The
<I>close</I>

routines may fail and set
<I>errno</I>

for any of the errors specified for the library routines
<B><A HREF="../man2/close.2.html">close</A></B>(2),

<B><A HREF="../man2/read.2.html">read</A></B>(2),

<B><A HREF="../man2/write.2.html">write</A></B>(2),

<B><A HREF="../man3/free.3.html">free</A></B>(3),

or
<B><A HREF="../man2/fsync.2.html">fsync</A></B>(2).

<P>

The
<I>del</I>,

<I>get</I>,

<I>put</I>,

and
<I>seq</I>

routines may fail and set
<I>errno</I>

for any of the errors specified for the library routines
<B><A HREF="../man2/read.2.html">read</A></B>(2),

<B><A HREF="../man2/write.2.html">write</A></B>(2),

<B><A HREF="../man3/free.3.html">free</A></B>(3)

or
<B><A HREF="../man3/malloc.3.html">malloc</A></B>(3).

<P>

The
<I>fd</I>

routines will fail and set
<I>errno</I>

to
<B>ENOENT</B>

for in memory databases.
<P>

The
<I>sync</I>

routines may fail and set
<I>errno</I>

for any of the errors specified for the library routine
<B><A HREF="../man2/fsync.2.html">fsync</A></B>(2).

<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>BUGS</H2>

The typedef
<I>DBT</I>

is a mnemonic for &quot;data base thang&quot;, and was used
because no one could think of a reasonable name that wasn't already used.
<P>

The file descriptor interface is a kludge and will be deleted in a
future version of the interface.
<P>

None of the access methods provide any form of concurrent access,
locking, or transactions.
