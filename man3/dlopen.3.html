<H2>NAME</H2>

dladdr, dlclose, dlerror, dlopen, dlsym, dlvsym - programming interface to
dynamic linking loader
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>#include &lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/dlfcn.h">dlfcn.h</A>&gt;</B>

<P>
<B>void *dlopen(const char *</B><I>filename</I><B>, int </B><I>flag</I><B>);</B>

<P>
Link with <I>-ldl</I>.
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The four functions
<B>dlopen</B>(),

<B>dlsym</B>(),

<B>dlclose</B>(),

<B>dlerror</B>()

implement the interface to the dynamic linking loader.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>dlerror()</H3>

The function
<B>dlerror</B>()

returns a human readable string describing the most recent error
that occurred from
<B>dlopen</B>(),

<B>dlsym</B>()

or
<B>dlclose</B>()

since the last call to
<B>dlerror</B>().

It returns NULL if no errors have occurred since initialization or since
it was last called.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>dlopen()</H3>

The function
<B>dlopen</B>()

loads the dynamic library file named by the null-terminated
string
<I>filename</I>

and returns an opaque &quot;handle&quot; for the dynamic library.
If
<I>filename</I>

is NULL, then the returned handle is for the main program.
If
<I>filename</I>

contains a slash (&quot;/&quot;), then it is interpreted as a (relative
or absolute) pathname.
Otherwise, the dynamic linker searches for the library as follows
(see
<B><A HREF="../man8/ld.so.8.html">ld.so</A></B>(8)

for further details):
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>o<DD>
(ELF only) If the executable file for the calling program
contains a DT_RPATH tag, and does not contain a DT_RUNPATH tag,
then the directories listed in the DT_RPATH tag are searched.
<DT>o<DD>
If the environment variable
<B>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</B>

is defined to contain a colon-separated list of directories,
then these are searched.
(As a security measure this variable is ignored for set-user-ID and
set-group-ID programs.)
<DT>o<DD>
(ELF only) If the executable file for the calling program
contains a DT_RUNPATH tag, then the directories listed in that tag
are searched.
<DT>o<DD>
The cache file
<I>/etc/ld.so.cache</I>

(maintained by
<B><A HREF="../man8/ldconfig.8.html">ldconfig</A></B>(8))

is checked to see whether it contains an entry for
<I>filename</I>.

<DT>o<DD>
The directories
<I>/lib</I>

and
<I>/usr/lib</I>

are searched (in that order).
</DL>
<P>

If the library has dependencies on other shared libraries,
then these are also automatically loaded by the dynamic linker
using the same rules.
(This process may occur recursively,
if those libraries in turn have dependencies, and so on.)
<P>

One of the following two values must be included in
<I>flag</I>:

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>RTLD_LAZY</B>

<DD>
Perform lazy binding.
Only resolve symbols as the code that references them is executed.
If the symbol is never referenced, then it is never resolved.
(Lazy binding is only performed for function references;
references to variables are always immediately bound when
the library is loaded.)
<DT><B>RTLD_NOW</B>

<DD>
If this value is specified, or the environment variable
<B>LD_BIND_NOW</B>

is set to a nonempty string,
all undefined symbols in the library are resolved before
<B>dlopen</B>()

returns.
If this cannot be done, an error is returned.
</DL>
<P>

Zero of more of the following values may also be ORed in
<I>flag</I>:

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>RTLD_GLOBAL</B>

<DD>
The symbols defined by this library will be
made available for symbol resolution of subsequently loaded libraries.
<DT><B>RTLD_LOCAL</B>

<DD>
This is the converse of
<B>RTLD_GLOBAL</B>,

and the default if neither flag is specified.
Symbols defined in this library are not made available to resolve
references in subsequently loaded libraries.
<DT><B>RTLD_NODELETE</B> (since glibc 2.2)

<DD>
Do not unload the library during
<B>dlclose</B>().

Consequently, the library's static variables are not reinitialized
if the library is reloaded with
<B>dlopen</B>()

at a later time.
This flag is not specified in POSIX.1-2001.

<DT><B>RTLD_NOLOAD</B> (since glibc 2.2)

<DD>
Don't load the library.
This can be used to test if the library is already resident
(<B>dlopen</B>()

returns NULL if it is not, or the library's handle if it is resident).
This flag can also be used to promote the flags on a library
that is already loaded.
For example, a library that was previously loaded with
<B>RTLD_LOCAL</B>

can be re-opened with
<B>RTLD_NOLOAD&nbsp;|&nbsp;RTLD_GLOBAL</B>.

This flag is not specified in POSIX.1-2001.


<DT><B>RTLD_DEEPBIND</B> (since glibc 2.3.4)

<DD>


Place the lookup scope of the symbols in this
library ahead of the global scope.
This means that a self-contained library will use
its own symbols in preference to global symbols with the same name
contained in libraries that have already been loaded.
This flag is not specified in POSIX.1-2001.
</DL>
<P>

If
<I>filename</I>

is a NULL pointer, then the returned handle is for the main program.
When given to
<B>dlsym</B>(),

this handle causes a search for a symbol in the main program,
followed by all shared libraries loaded at program startup,
and then all shared libraries loaded by
<B>dlopen</B>()

with the flag
<B>RTLD_GLOBAL</B>.

<P>

External references in the library are resolved using the libraries
in that library's dependency list and any other libraries previously
opened with the
<B>RTLD_GLOBAL</B>

flag.
If the executable was linked with the flag &quot;-rdynamic&quot;
(or, synonymously, &quot;--export-dynamic&quot;),
then the global symbols in the executable will also be used
to resolve references in a dynamically loaded library.
<P>

If the same library is loaded again with
<B>dlopen</B>(),

the same file handle is returned.
The dl library maintains reference
counts for library handles, so a dynamic library is not
deallocated until
<B>dlclose</B>()

has been called on it as many times as
<B>dlopen</B>()

has succeeded on it.
The
<B>_init</B>()

routine, if present, is only called once.
But a subsequent call with
<B>RTLD_NOW</B>

may force symbol resolution for a library earlier loaded with
<B>RTLD_LAZY</B>.

<P>

If
<B>dlopen</B>()

fails for any reason, it returns NULL.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>dlsym()</H3>

The function
<B>dlsym</B>()

takes a &quot;handle&quot; of a dynamic library returned by
<B>dlopen</B>()

and the
null-terminated symbol name, returning the address where that symbol is
loaded into memory.
If the symbol is not found, in the specified
library or any of the libraries that were automatically loaded by
<B>dlopen</B>()

when that library was loaded,
<B>dlsym</B>()

returns NULL.
(The search performed by
<B>dlsym</B>()

is breadth first through the dependency tree of these libraries.)
Since the value of the symbol could actually be NULL (so that a
NULL return from
<B>dlsym</B>()

need not indicate an error), the correct way to test for an error
is to call
<B>dlerror</B>()

to clear any old error conditions, then call
<B>dlsym</B>(),

and then call
<B>dlerror</B>()

again, saving its return value into a variable, and check whether
this saved value is not NULL.
<P>

There are two special pseudo-handles,
<B>RTLD_DEFAULT</B>

and
<B>RTLD_NEXT</B>.

The former will find the first occurrence of the desired symbol
using the default library search order.
The latter
will find the next occurrence of a function in the search order
after the current library.
This allows one to provide a wrapper
around a function in another shared library.
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>dlclose()</H3>

The function
<B>dlclose</B>()

decrements the reference count on the dynamic library handle
<I>handle</I>.

If the reference count drops to zero and no other loaded libraries use
symbols in it, then the dynamic library is unloaded.
<P>

The function
<B>dlclose</B>()

returns 0 on success, and nonzero on error.
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>The obsolete symbols _init() and _fini()</H3>

The linker recognizes special symbols
<B>_init</B>

and
<B>_fini</B>.

If a dynamic library exports a routine named
<B>_init</B>(),

then that code is executed after the loading, before
<B>dlopen</B>()

returns.
If the dynamic library exports a routine named
<B>_fini</B>(),

then that routine is called just before the library is unloaded.
In case you  need to  avoid  linking against the system startup files,
this can be done by using the
<B><A HREF="../man1/gcc.1.html">gcc</A></B>(1)

<I>-nostartfiles</I>

command-line option.
<P>

Using these routines, or the gcc
<B>-nostartfiles</B>

or
<B>-nostdlib</B>

options, is not recommended.
Their use may result in undesired behavior,
since the constructor/destructor routines will not be executed
(unless special measures are taken).


<P>

Instead, libraries should export routines using the
<B>__attribute__((constructor))</B>

and
<B>__attribute__((destructor))</B>

function attributes.
See the gcc info pages for information on these.
Constructor routines are executed before
<B>dlopen</B>()

returns, and destructor routines are executed before
<B>dlclose</B>()

returns.
<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Glibc extensions: dladdr() and dlvsym()</H3>

Glibc adds two functions not described by POSIX, with prototypes
<P>
<PRE>
<B>#define _GNU_SOURCE</B>
<B>#include &lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/dlfcn.h">dlfcn.h</A>&gt;</B>

<B>int dladdr(void *</B><I>addr</I><B>, Dl_info *</B><I>info</I><B>);</B>

<B>void *dlvsym(void *</B><I>handle</I><B>, char *</B><I>symbol</I><B>, char *</B><I>version</I><B>);</B>
</PRE>

<P>

The function
<B>dladdr</B>()

takes a function pointer and tries to resolve name
and file where it is located.
Information is stored in the
<I>Dl_info</I>

structure:
<P>

<PRE>
typedef struct {
    const char *dli_fname;  /* Filename of defining object */
    void       *dli_fbase;  /* Load address of that object */
    const char *dli_sname;  /* Name of nearest lower symbol */
    void       *dli_saddr;  /* Exact value of nearest symbol */
} Dl_info;
</PRE>


<P>
<B>dladdr</B>()

returns 0 on error, and nonzero on success.
<P>

The function
<B>dlvsym</B>()

does the same as
<B>dlsym</B>()

but takes a version string as an additional argument.
<A NAME="lbAK">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>CONFORMING TO</H2>

POSIX.1-2001 describes
<B>dlclose</B>(),

<B>dlerror</B>(),

<B>dlopen</B>(),

and
<B>dlsym</B>().

<A NAME="lbAL">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NOTES</H2>

The symbols
<B>RTLD_DEFAULT</B>

and
<B>RTLD_NEXT</B>

are defined by
<I>&lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/dlfcn.h">dlfcn.h</A>&gt;</I>

only when
<B>_GNU_SOURCE</B>

was defined before including it.









<P>
Since glibc 2.2.3,
<B><A HREF="../man3/atexit.3.html">atexit</A></B>(3)

can be used to register an exit handler that is automatically
called when a library is unloaded.
<A NAME="lbAM">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>History</H3>

The dlopen interface standard comes from SunOS.
That system also has
<B>dladdr</B>(),

but not
<B>dlvsym</B>().

<A NAME="lbAN">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>EXAMPLE</H2>

Load the math library, and print the cosine of 2.0:
<PRE>

#include &lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/stdio.h">stdio.h</A>&gt;
#include &lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/stdlib.h">stdlib.h</A>&gt;
#include &lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/dlfcn.h">dlfcn.h</A>&gt;

int
main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    void *handle;
    double (*cosine)(double);
    char *error;

    handle = dlopen(&quot;libm.so&quot;, RTLD_LAZY);
    if (!handle) {
        fprintf(stderr, &quot;%s\n&quot;, dlerror());
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    dlerror();    /* Clear any existing error */

    /* Writing: cosine = (double (*)(double)) dlsym(handle, &quot;cos&quot;);
       would seem more natural, but the C99 standard leaves
       casting from &quot;void *&quot; to a function pointer undefined.
       The assignment used below is the POSIX.1-2003 (Technical
       Corrigendum 1) workaround; see the Rationale for the
       POSIX specification of dlsym(). */

    *(void **) (&amp;cosine) = dlsym(handle, &quot;cos&quot;);

    if ((error = dlerror()) != NULL)  {
        fprintf(stderr, &quot;%s\n&quot;, error);
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    printf(&quot;%f\n&quot;, (*cosine)(2.0));
    dlclose(handle);
    exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
}
</PRE>

<P>

If this program were in a file named &quot;foo.c&quot;, you would build the program
with the following command:

<P>

gcc -rdynamic -o foo foo.c -ldl

<P>

Libraries exporting
<B>_init</B>()

and
<B>_fini</B>()

will want to be compiled as
follows, using <I>bar.c</I> as the example name:

<P>

gcc -shared -nostartfiles -o bar bar.c
