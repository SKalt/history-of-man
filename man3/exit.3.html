<H2>NAME</H2>

exit - cause normal process termination
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<PRE>
<B>#include &lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/stdlib.h">stdlib.h</A>&gt;</B>

<B>void exit(int </B><I>status</I><B>);</B>
</PRE>

<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The <B>exit</B>() function causes normal process termination and the
value of <I>status &amp; 0377</I> is returned to the parent
(see
<B><A HREF="../man2/wait.2.html">wait</A></B>(2)).

<P>

All functions registered with
<B>atexit</B>() and <B>on_exit</B>()
are called, in the reverse order of their registration.
(It is possible for one of these functions to use
<B>atexit</B>() or <B>on_exit</B>() to register an additional
function to be executed during exit processing;
the new registration is added to the front of the list of functions
that remain to be called.)
<P>

All open streams are flushed and closed.
Files created by <B>tmpfile</B>() are removed.
<P>

The C standard specifies two constants,
<I>EXIT_SUCCESS</I> and <I>EXIT_FAILURE</I>,
that may be passed to <B>exit</B>() to indicate successful or unsuccessful
termination, respectively.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

The <B>exit</B>() function does not return.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>CONFORMING TO</H2>

SVID 3, POSIX, BSD 4.3, ISO 9899 (``ANSI C'')
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NOTES</H2>

<P>

It is undefined what happens if one of the
functions registered using <B>atexit</B>() and <B>on_exit</B>()
calls either <B>exit</B>() or <B>longjmp</B>().
<P>

The use of EXIT_SUCCESS and EXIT_FAILURE is slightly more portable
(to non-Unix environments) than that of 0 and some non-zero value
like 1 or -1. In particular, VMS uses a different convention.
<P>

BSD has attempted to standardize exit codes; see the file
<I>&lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/sysexits.h">sysexits.h</A>&gt;</I>.

<P>

After <B>exit</B>(), the exit status must be transmitted to the
parent process. There are three cases. If the parent has set
SA_NOCLDWAIT, or has set the SIGCHLD handler to SIG_IGN, the
status is discarded. If the parent was waiting on the child
it is notified of the exit status. In both cases the exiting
process dies immediately. If the parent has not indicated that
it is not interested in the exit status, but is not waiting,
the exiting process turns into a &quot;zombie&quot; process
(which is nothing but a container for the single byte representing
the exit status) so that the parent can learn the exit status when
it later calls one of the <I>wait</I>() functions.
<P>

If the implementation supports the SIGCHLD signal, this signal
is sent to the parent. If the parent has set SA_NOCLDWAIT,
it is undefined whether a SIGCHLD signal is sent.
<P>

If the process is a session leader and its controlling terminal
the controlling terminal of the session, then each process in
the foreground process group of this controlling terminal
is sent a SIGHUP signal, and the terminal is disassociated
from this session, allowing it to be acquired by a new controlling
process.
<P>

If the exit of the process causes a process group to become orphaned,
and if any member of the newly orphaned process group is stopped,
then a SIGHUP signal followed by a SIGCONT signal will be
sent to each process in this process group.
