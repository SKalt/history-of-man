flockfile, ftrylockfile, funlockfile - lock FILE for stdio
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<PRE>
<B>#include &lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/stdio.h">stdio.h</A>&gt;</B>

<B>void flockfile(FILE *</B><I>filehandle</I><B>);</B>
<BR>
<B>int ftrylockfile(FILE *</B><I>filehandle</I><B>);</B>
<BR>
<B>void funlockfile(FILE *</B><I>filehandle</I><B>);</B>
</PRE>

<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The stdio functions are thread-safe. This is achieved by assigning
to each FILE object a lockcount and (if the lockcount is non-zero)
an owning thread.
For each library call, these functions wait until the FILE object
is no longer locked by a different thread, then lock it, do the
requested I/O, and unlock the object again.
<P>

(Note: this locking has nothing to do with the file locking done
by functions like
<B><A HREF="../man2/flock.2.html">flock</A></B>(2)

and
<B><A HREF="../man3/lockf.3.html">lockf</A></B>(3).)

<P>

All this is invisible to the C-programmer, but there may be two
reasons to wish for more detailed control. On the one hand, maybe
a series of I/O actions by one thread belongs together, and should
not be interrupted by the I/O of some other thread.
On the other hand, maybe the locking overhead should be avoided
for greater efficiency.
<P>

To this end, a thread can explicitly lock the FILE object,
then do its series of I/O actions, then unlock. This prevents
other threads from coming in between. If the reason for doing
this was to achieve greater efficiency, one does the I/O with
the non-locking versions of the stdio functions: with
<I>getc_unlocked</I>() and <I>putc_unlocked</I>() instead of
<I>getc</I>() and <I>putc</I>().
<P>

The <B>flockfile</B>() function waits for *<I>filehandle</I> to be
no longer locked by a different thread, then makes the
current thread owner of *<I>filehandle</I>, and increments
the lockcount.
<P>

The <B>funlockfile</B>() function decrements the lock count.
<P>

The <B>ftrylockfile</B>() function is a non-blocking version
of <B>flockfile</B>(). It does nothing in case some other thread
owns *<I>filehandle</I>, and it obtains ownership and increments
the lockcount otherwise.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

The <B>ftrylockfile</B>() function returns zero for success
(the lock was obtained), and non-zero for failure.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

None.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>AVAILABILITY</H2>

These functions are available when _POSIX_THREAD_SAFE_FUNCTIONS
is defined. They are in libc since libc 5.1.1 and in glibc
since glibc 2.0.
