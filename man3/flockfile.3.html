</DL>


<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The stdio functions are thread-safe.
This is achieved by assigning
to each
<I>FILE</I>

object a lockcount and (if the lockcount is nonzero)
an owning thread.
For each library call, these functions wait until the
<I>FILE</I>

object
is no longer locked by a different thread, then lock it, do the
requested I/O, and unlock the object again.
<P>

(Note: this locking has nothing to do with the file locking done
by functions like
<B><A HREF="../man2/flock.2.html">flock</A></B>(2)

and
<B><A HREF="../man3/lockf.3.html">lockf</A></B>(3).)

<P>

All this is invisible to the C-programmer, but there may be two
reasons to wish for more detailed control.
On the one hand, maybe
a series of I/O actions by one thread belongs together, and should
not be interrupted by the I/O of some other thread.
On the other hand, maybe the locking overhead should be avoided
for greater efficiency.
<P>

To this end, a thread can explicitly lock the
<I>FILE</I>

object,
then do its series of I/O actions, then unlock.
This prevents
other threads from coming in between.
If the reason for doing
this was to achieve greater efficiency, one does the I/O with
the nonlocking versions of the stdio functions: with
<B><A HREF="../man3/getc_unlocked.3.html">getc_unlocked</A></B>(3)

and
<B><A HREF="../man3/putc_unlocked.3.html">putc_unlocked</A></B>(3)

instead of
<B><A HREF="../man3/getc.3.html">getc</A></B>(3)

and
<B><A HREF="../man3/putc.3.html">putc</A></B>(3).

<P>

The
<B>flockfile</B>()

function waits for
<I>*filehandle</I>

to be
no longer locked by a different thread, then makes the
current thread owner of
<I>*filehandle</I>,

and increments
the lockcount.
<P>

The
<B>funlockfile</B>()

function decrements the lock count.
<P>

The
<B>ftrylockfile</B>()

function is a nonblocking version
of
<B>flockfile</B>().

It does nothing in case some other thread
owns
<I>*filehandle</I>,

and it obtains ownership and increments
the lockcount otherwise.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

The
<B>ftrylockfile</B>()

function returns zero for success
(the lock was obtained), and nonzero for failure.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

None.
