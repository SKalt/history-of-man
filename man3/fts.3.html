<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The
<B>fts</B>

functions are provided for traversing
<B>UNIX</B>

file hierarchies.
A simple overview is that the
Fn fts_open

function returns a ``handle'' on a file hierarchy, which is then supplied to
the other
<B>fts</B>

functions.
The function
Fn fts_read

returns a pointer to a structure describing one of the files in the file
hierarchy.
The function
Fn fts_children

returns a pointer to a linked list of structures, each of which describes
one of the files contained in a directory in the hierarchy.
In general, directories are visited two distinguishable times; in pre-order
(before any of their descendants are visited) and in post-order (after all
of their descendants have been visited).
Files are visited once.
It is possible to walk the hierarchy ``logically'' (ignoring symbolic links)
or physically (visiting symbolic links), order the walk of the hierarchy or
prune and/or re-visit portions of the hierarchy.
<P>

Two structures are defined (and typedef'd) in the include file
Aq Pa fts.h .

The first is
Fa FTS ,

the structure that represents the file hierarchy itself.
The second is
Fa FTSENT ,

the structure that represents a file in the file
hierarchy.
Normally, an
Fa FTSENT

structure is returned for every file in the file
hierarchy.
In this manual page, ``file'' and
``Fa FTSENT <B>structure</B>



''

are generally
interchangeable.
The
Fa FTSENT

structure contains at least the following fields, which are
described in greater detail below:

<PRE>
typedef struct _ftsent {
        u_short fts_info;               /* flags for FTSENT structure */
        char *fts_accpath;              /* access path */
        char *fts_path;                 /* root path */
        short fts_pathlen;              /* strlen(fts_path) */
        char *fts_name;                 /* filename */
        short fts_namelen;              /* strlen(fts_name) */
        short fts_level;                /* depth (-1 to N) */
        int fts_errno;                  /* file errno */
        long fts_number;                /* local numeric value */
        void *fts_pointer;              /* local address value */
        struct ftsent *fts_parent;      /* parent directory */
        struct ftsent *fts_link;        /* next file structure */
        struct ftsent *fts_cycle;       /* cycle structure */
        struct stat *fts_statp;         /* <A HREF="../man2/stat.2.html">stat</A>(2) information */
} FTSENT;
</PRE>

<P>

These fields are defined as follows:
<DL COMPACT>
<P>

<DT><B>Fa </B>fts_info


<DD>
One of the following flags describing the returned
Fa FTSENT

structure and
the file it represents.
With the exception of directories without errors
(<B>FTS_D</B>

)

 
all of these
entries are terminal, that is, they will not be revisited, nor will any
of their descendants be visited.
<DL COMPACT>
<P>

<DT><B>FTS_D</B>


<DD>
A directory being visited in pre-order.
<DT><B>FTS_DC</B>


<DD>
A directory that causes a cycle in the tree.
(The
Fa fts_cycle

field of the
Fa FTSENT

structure will be filled in as well.)
<DT><B>FTS_DEFAULT</B>


<DD>
Any
Fa FTSENT

structure that represents a file type not explicitly described
by one of the other
Fa fts_info

values.
<DT><B>FTS_DNR</B>


<DD>

This is an error return, and the
Fa fts_errno

field will be set to indicate what caused the error.
<DT><B>FTS_DOT</B>

`.'

or
`..'

which was not specified as a filename to
Fn fts_open

(see
<B>FTS_SEEDOT )</B>

 
<DT><B>FTS_DP</B>


<DD>
A directory being visited in post-order.
The contents of the
Fa FTSENT

structure will be unchanged from when
it was returned in pre-order, that is, with the
Fa fts_info

field set to
<B>FTS_D</B>

 
<DT><B>FTS_ERR</B>


<DD>
This is an error return, and the
Fa fts_errno

<DT><B>FTS_F</B>


<DD>
A regular file.
<DT><B>FTS_NS</B>


<DD>
A file for which no
<A HREF="../man2/stat.2.html">stat</A>(2)


information was available.
The contents of the
Fa fts_statp

Fa fts_errno

field will be set to indicate what caused the error.
<DT><B>FTS_NSOK</B>


<DD>
A file for which no
<A HREF="../man2/stat.2.html">stat</A>(2)


information was requested.

field are undefined.
<DT><B>FTS_SL</B>


<DD>
A symbolic link.
<DT><B>FTS_SLNONE</B>


<DD>
A symbolic link with a non-existent target.
The contents of the
Fa fts_statp

field reference the file characteristic information for the symbolic link
itself.
</DL>
<P>

<DT><B>Fa </B>fts_accpath


<DD>
A path for accessing the file from the current directory.
<DT><B>Fa </B>fts_path


<DD>
The path for the file relative to the root of the traversal.
This path contains the path specified to
Fn fts_open

as a prefix.
<DT><B>Fa </B>fts_pathlen


<DD>
The length of the string referenced by
Fa fts_path .

<DT><B>Fa </B>fts_name


<DD>
The name of the file.
<DT><B>Fa </B>fts_namelen


<DD>
The length of the string referenced by
Fa fts_name .

<DT><B>Fa </B>fts_level


<DD>
The depth of the traversal, numbered from -1 to N, where this file
was found.
The
Fa FTSENT

structure representing the parent of the starting point (or root)
of the traversal is numbered -1, and the
Fa FTSENT

structure for the root
itself is numbered 0.
<DT><B>Fa </B>fts_errno


<DD>
Upon return of a
Fa FTSENT

structure from the
Fn fts_children

or
Fn fts_read

functions, with its
Fa fts_info

field set to
<B>FTS_DNR</B>

 
<B>FTS_ERR</B>

or
<B>FTS_NS</B>

 
the
Fa fts_errno

field contains the value of the external variable
<I>errno</I>

specifying the cause of the error.
Otherwise, the contents of the
Fa fts_errno

field are undefined.
<DT><B>Fa </B>fts_number


<DD>
This field is provided for the use of the application program and is
not modified by the
<B>fts</B>

functions.
It is initialized to 0.
<DT><B>Fa </B>fts_pointer


<DD>
This field is provided for the use of the application program and is
not modified by the
<B>fts</B>

functions.
It is initialized to
<B>NULL</B>

 
<DT><B>Fa </B>fts_parent


<DD>
A pointer to the
Fa FTSENT

structure referencing the file in the hierarchy
immediately above the current file, that is, the directory of which this
file is a member.
A parent structure for the initial entry point is provided as well,
however, only the
Fa fts_level ,

Fa fts_number

and
Fa fts_pointer

fields are guaranteed to be initialized.
<DT><B>Fa </B>fts_link


<DD>
Upon return from the
Fn fts_children

function, the
Fa fts_link

field points to the next structure in the NULL-terminated linked list of
directory members.
Otherwise, the contents of the
Fa fts_link

field are undefined.
<DT><B>Fa </B>fts_cycle


<DD>
If a directory causes a cycle in the hierarchy (see
<B>FTS_DC )</B>

 
either because
of a hard link between two directories, or a symbolic link pointing to a
directory, the
Fa fts_cycle

field of the structure will point to the
Fa FTSENT

structure in the hierarchy that references the same file as the current
Fa FTSENT

structure.
Otherwise, the contents of the
Fa fts_cycle

field are undefined.
<DT><B>Fa </B>fts_statp


<DD>
A pointer to
<A HREF="../man2/stat.2.html">stat</A>(2)


information for the file.
</DL>
<P>

<P>

A single buffer is used for all of the paths of all of the files in the
file hierarchy.
Therefore, the
Fa fts_path

and
Fa fts_accpath

fields are guaranteed to be
<B>NULL -terminated</B>



<I>only</I>

for the file most recently returned by
Fn fts_read .

To use these fields to reference any files represented by other
Fa FTSENT

structures will require that the path buffer be modified using the
information contained in that
Fa FTSENT

structure's
Fa fts_pathlen

field.
Any such modifications should be undone before further calls to
Fn fts_read

are attempted.
The
Fa fts_name

field is always
<B>NULL -terminated.</B>



<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>FTS_OPEN</H2>

The
Fn fts_open

function takes a pointer to an array of character pointers naming one
or more paths which make up a logical file hierarchy to be traversed.
The array must be terminated by a
<B>NULL</B>

pointer.
<P>

There are
a number of options, at least one of which (either
<B>FTS_LOGICAL</B>

or
<B>FTS_PHYSICAL</B>

 
must be specified.
The options are selected by
<I>or </I><B>'ing</B>



the following values:
<DL COMPACT>
<P>

<DT><B>FTS_COMFOLLOW</B>


<DD>
This option causes any symbolic link specified as a root path to be
followed immediately whether or not
<B>FTS_LOGICAL</B>

is also specified.
<DT><B>FTS_LOGICAL</B>


<DD>
This option causes the
<B>fts</B>

routines to return
Fa FTSENT

structures for the targets of symbolic links
instead of the symbolic links themselves.
If this option is set, the only symbolic links for which
Fa FTSENT

structures
are returned to the application are those referencing non-existent files.
Either
<B>FTS_LOGICAL</B>

or
<B>FTS_PHYSICAL</B>

<I>must</I>

be provided to the
Fn fts_open

function.
<DT><B>FTS_NOCHDIR</B>


<DD>
As a performance optimization, the
<B>fts</B>

functions change directories as they walk the file hierarchy.
This has the side-effect that an application cannot rely on being
in any particular directory during the traversal.
The
<B>FTS_NOCHDIR</B>

option turns off this optimization, and the
<B>fts</B>

functions will not change the current directory.
Note that applications should not themselves change their current directory
and try to access files unless
<B>FTS_NOCHDIR</B>

is specified and absolute
pathnames were provided as arguments to
Fn fts_open .

<DT><B>FTS_NOSTAT</B>


<DD>
By default, returned
Fa FTSENT

structures reference file characteristic information (the
Fa statp

field) for each file visited.
This option relaxes that requirement as a performance optimization,
allowing the
<B>fts</B>

functions to set the
Fa fts_info

field to
<B>FTS_NSOK</B>

and leave the contents of the
Fa statp

field undefined.
<DT><B>FTS_PHYSICAL</B>


<DD>
This option causes the
<B>fts</B>

routines to return
Fa FTSENT

structures for symbolic links themselves instead
of the target files they point to.
If this option is set,
Fa FTSENT

structures for all symbolic links in the
hierarchy are returned to the application.
Either
<B>FTS_LOGICAL</B>

or
<B>FTS_PHYSICAL</B>

<I>must</I>

be provided to the
Fn fts_open

function.
<DT><B>FTS_SEEDOT</B>


<DD>
By default, unless they are specified as path arguments to
Fn fts_open ,

any files named
`.'

or
`..'

encountered in the file hierarchy are ignored.
This option causes the
<B>fts</B>

routines to return
Fa FTSENT

structures for them.
<DT><B>FTS_XDEV</B>


<DD>
This option prevents
<B>fts</B>

from descending into directories that have a different device number
than the file from which the descent began.
</DL>
<P>

<P>

The argument
Fn compar

specifies a user-defined function which may be used to order the traversal
of the hierarchy.
It
takes two pointers to pointers to
Fa FTSENT

structures as arguments and
should return a negative value, zero, or a positive value to indicate
if the file referenced by its first argument comes before, in any order
with respect to, or after, the file referenced by its second argument.
The
Fa fts_accpath ,

Fa fts_path

and
Fa fts_pathlen

fields of the
Fa FTSENT

structures may
<I>never</I>

be used in this comparison.
If the
Fa fts_info

field is set to
<B>FTS_NS</B>

or
<B>FTS_NSOK</B>

 
the
Fa fts_statp

field may not either.
If the
Fn compar

argument is
<B>NULL</B>

 
the directory traversal order is in the order listed in
Fa path_argv

for the root paths, and in the order listed in the directory for
everything else.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>FTS_READ</H2>

The
Fn fts_read

function returns a pointer to an
Fa FTSENT

structure describing a file in
the hierarchy.
Directories (that are readable and do not cause cycles) are visited at
least twice, once in pre-order and once in post-order.
All other files are visited at least once.
(Hard links between directories that do not cause cycles or symbolic
links to symbolic links may cause files to be visited more than once,
or directories more than twice.)
<P>

If all the members of the hierarchy have been returned,
Fn fts_read

returns
<B>NULL</B>

and sets the external variable
<I>errno</I>

to 0.
If an error unrelated to a file in the hierarchy occurs,
Fn fts_read

returns
<B>NULL</B>

and sets
<I>errno</I>

appropriately.
If an error related to a returned file occurs, a pointer to an
Fa FTSENT

structure is returned, and
<I>errno</I>

may or may not have been set (see
Fa fts_info ) .

<P>

The
Fa FTSENT

structures returned by
Fn fts_read

may be overwritten after a call to
Fn fts_close

on the same file hierarchy stream, or, after a call to
Fn fts_read

on the same file hierarchy stream unless they represent a file of type
directory, in which case they will not be overwritten until after a call to
Fn fts_read

after the
Fa FTSENT

structure has been returned by the function
Fn fts_read

in post-order.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>FTS_CHILDREN</H2>

The
Fn fts_children

function returns a pointer to an
Fa FTSENT

structure describing the first entry in a NULL-terminated linked list of
the files in the directory represented by the
Fa FTSENT

structure most recently returned by
Fn fts_read .

The list is linked through the
Fa fts_link

field of the
Fa FTSENT

structure, and is ordered by the user-specified comparison function, if any.
Repeated calls to
Fn fts_children

will recreate this linked list.
<P>

As a special case, if
Fn fts_read

has not yet been called for a hierarchy,
Fn fts_children

will return a pointer to the files in the logical directory specified to
Fn fts_open ,

that is, the arguments specified to
Fn fts_open .

Otherwise, if the
Fa FTSENT

structure most recently returned by
Fn fts_read

is not a directory being visited in pre-order,
or the directory does not contain any files,
Fn fts_children

returns
<B>NULL</B>

and sets
<I>errno</I>

to zero.
If an error occurs,
Fn fts_children

returns
<B>NULL</B>

and sets
<I>errno</I>

appropriately.
<P>

The
Fa FTSENT

structures returned by
Fn fts_children

may be overwritten after a call to
Fn fts_children ,

Fn fts_close

or
Fn fts_read

on the same file hierarchy stream.
<P>

<I>Option</I>

may be set to the following value:
<DL COMPACT>
<P>

<DT><B>FTS_NAMEONLY</B>


<DD>
Only the names of the files are needed.
The contents of all the fields in the returned linked list of structures
are undefined with the exception of the
Fa fts_name

and
Fa fts_namelen

fields.
</DL>
<P>

<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>FTS_SET</H2>

The function
Fn fts_set

allows the user application to determine further processing for the
file
Fa f

of the stream
Fa ftsp .

The
Fn fts_set

function
returns 0 on success, and -1 if an error occurs.
<I>Option</I>

must be set to one of the following values:
<DL COMPACT>
<P>

<DT><B>FTS_AGAIN</B>


<DD>
Re-visit the file; any file type may be re-visited.
The next call to
Fn fts_read

will return the referenced file.
The
Fa fts_stat

and
Fa fts_info

fields of the structure will be reinitialized at that time,
but no other fields will have been changed.
This option is meaningful only for the most recently returned
file from
Fn fts_read .

Normal use is for post-order directory visits, where it causes the
directory to be re-visited (in both pre and post-order) as well as all
of its descendants.
<DT><B>FTS_FOLLOW</B>


<DD>
The referenced file must be a symbolic link.
If the referenced file is the one most recently returned by
Fn fts_read ,

the next call to
Fn fts_read

returns the file with the
Fa fts_info

and
Fa fts_statp

fields reinitialized to reflect the target of the symbolic link instead
of the symbolic link itself.
If the file is one of those most recently returned by
Fn fts_children ,

the
Fa fts_info

and
Fa fts_statp

fields of the structure, when returned by
Fn fts_read ,

will reflect the target of the symbolic link instead of the symbolic link
itself.
In either case, if the target of the symbolic link does not exist the
fields of the returned structure will be unchanged and the
Fa fts_info

field will be set to
<B>FTS_SLNONE</B>

 
<P>

If the target of the link is a directory, the pre-order return, followed
by the return of all of its descendants, followed by a post-order return,
is done.
<DT><B>FTS_SKIP</B>


<DD>
No descendants of this file are visited.
The file may be one of those most recently returned by either
Fn fts_children

or
Fn fts_read .

</DL>
<P>

<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>FTS_CLOSE</H2>

The
Fn fts_close

function closes a file hierarchy stream
Fa ftsp

and restores the current directory to the directory from which
Fn fts_open

was called to open
Fa ftsp .

The
Fn fts_close

function
returns 0 on success, and -1 if an error occurs.
<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

The function
Fn fts_open

may fail and set
<I>errno</I>

for any of the errors specified for the library functions
<A HREF="../man2/open.2.html">open</A>(2)


and
<A HREF="../man3/malloc.3.html">malloc</A>(3).


<P>

The function
Fn fts_close

may fail and set
<I>errno</I>

for any of the errors specified for the library functions
<A HREF="../man2/chdir.2.html">chdir</A>(2)


and
<A HREF="../man2/close.2.html">close</A>(2).


<P>

The functions
Fn fts_read

<P>

In addition,
Fn fts_children ,

Fn fts_open

and
