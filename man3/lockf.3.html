<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

Apply, test or remove a POSIX lock on a section of an open file.
The file is specified by
<I>fd</I>,

a file descriptor open for writing, the action by
<I>cmd</I>,

and the section consists of byte positions
<I>pos</I>..<I>pos</I>+<I>len</I>-1

if
<I>len</I>

is positive, and
<I>pos</I>-<I>len</I>..<I>pos</I>-1

if
<I>len</I>

is negative, where
<I>pos</I>

is the current file position, and if
<I>len</I>

is zero, the section extends from the current file position to
infinity, encompassing the present and future end-of-file positions.
In all cases, the section may extend past current end-of-file.
<P>

On Linux,
<B>lockf</B>()

is just an interface on top of
<B><A HREF="../man2/fcntl.2.html">fcntl</A></B>(2)

locking.
Many other systems implement
<B>lockf</B>()

in this way, but note that POSIX.1-2001 leaves the relationship between
<B>lockf</B>()

and
<B><A HREF="../man2/fcntl.2.html">fcntl</A></B>(2)

locks unspecified.
A portable application should probably avoid mixing calls
to these interfaces.
<P>

Valid operations are given below:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>F_LOCK</B>

<DD>
Set an exclusive lock on the specified section of the file.
If (part of) this section is already locked, the call
blocks until the previous lock is released.
If this section overlaps an earlier locked section,
both are merged.
File locks are released as soon as the process holding the locks
closes some file descriptor for the file.
A child process does not inherit these locks.
<DT><B>F_TLOCK</B>

<DD>
Same as
<B>F_LOCK</B>

but the call never blocks and returns an error instead if the file is
already locked.
<DT><B>F_ULOCK</B>

<DD>
Unlock the indicated section of the file.
This may cause a locked section to be split into two locked sections.
<DT><B>F_TEST</B>

<DD>
Test the lock: return 0 if the specified section
is unlocked or locked by this process; return -1, set
<I>errno</I>

to
<B>EAGAIN</B>

(<B>EACCES</B>

on some other systems),
if another process holds a lock.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

On success, zero is returned.
On error, -1 is returned, and
<I>errno</I>

is set appropriately.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EACCES</B> or <B>EAGAIN</B>

<DD>
The file is locked and
<B>F_TLOCK</B>

or
<B>F_TEST</B>

was specified, or the operation is prohibited because the file has
been memory-mapped by another process.
<DT><B>EBADF</B>

<DD>
<I>fd</I>

is not an open file descriptor; or
<I>cmd</I>

is
<B>F_LOCK</B>

or
<B>F_TLOCK</B>

and
<I>fd</I>

is not a writable file descriptor.
<DT><B>EDEADLK</B>

<DD>
The command was
<B>F_LOCK</B>

and this lock operation would cause a deadlock.
<DT><B>EINVAL</B>

<DD>
An invalid operation was specified in
<I>cmd</I>.

<DT><B>ENOLCK</B>

<DD>
Too many segment locks open, lock table is full.
