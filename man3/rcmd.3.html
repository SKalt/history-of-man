<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The
Fn rcmd

function
is used by the superuser to execute a command on
a remote machine using an authentication scheme based
on reserved port numbers.
The
Fn rresvport

function
returns a descriptor to a socket
with an address in the privileged port space.
The
Fn iruserok

and
Fn ruserok

functions are used by servers
to authenticate clients requesting service with
Fn rcmd .

All four functions are present in the same file and are used
by the
<A HREF="../man8/rshd.8.html">rshd</A>(8)


server (among others).
<P>

The
Fn rcmd

function
looks up the host
Fa *ahost

using
<A HREF="../man3/gethostbyname.3.html">gethostbyname</A>(3),


returning -1 if the host does not exist.
Otherwise
Fa *ahost

is set to the standard name of the host
and a connection is established to a server
residing at the well-known Internet port
Fa inport .

<P>

If the connection succeeds,
a socket in the Internet domain of type
<B>SOCK_STREAM</B>

is returned to the caller, and given to the remote
command as 
<I>stdin</I>

and
<I>stdout</I>

 
If
Fa fd2p

is non-zero, then an auxiliary channel to a control
process will be set up, and a descriptor for it will be placed
in
Fa *fd2p .

The control process will return diagnostic
output from the command (unit 2) on this channel, and will also
accept bytes on this channel as being
<B>UNIX</B>

signal numbers, to be
forwarded to the process group of the command.
If
Fa fd2p

is 0, then the 
<I>stderr</I>

(unit 2 of the remote
command) will be made the same as the 
<I>stdout</I>

and no
provision is made for sending arbitrary signals to the remote process,
although you may be able to get its attention by using out-of-band data.
<P>

The protocol is described in detail in
<A HREF="../man8/rshd.8.html">rshd</A>(8).


<P>

The
Fn rresvport

function is used to obtain a socket with a privileged
address bound to it.  This socket is suitable for use
by 
Fn rcmd

and several other functions.  Privileged Internet ports are those
in the range 0 to 1023.  Only the superuser
is allowed to bind an address of this sort to a socket.
<P>

The
Fn iruserok

and
Fn ruserok

functions take a remote host's IP address or name, respectively,
two user names and a flag indicating whether the local user's
name is that of the superuser.
Then, if the user is
<I>NOT</I>

the superuser, it checks the
/etc/hosts.equiv

file.
If that lookup is not done, or is unsuccessful, the
.rhosts

in the local user's home directory is checked to see if the request for
service is allowed.
<P>

If this file does not exist, is not a regular file, is owned by anyone
other than the user or the superuser, or is writeable by anyone other
than the owner, the check automatically fails.
Zero is returned if the machine name is listed in the
``hosts.equiv

''

file, or the host and remote user name are found in the
``.rhosts

''

file; otherwise
Fn iruserok

and
Fn ruserok

return -1.
If the local domain (as obtained from
<A HREF="../man2/gethostname.2.html">gethostname</A>(2))


is the same as the remote domain, only the machine name need be specified.
<P>

If the IP address of the remote host is known,
Fn iruserok

should be used in preference to
Fn ruserok ,

as it does not require trusting the DNS server for the remote host's domain.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DIAGNOSTICS</H2>

The
Fn rcmd

function
returns a valid socket descriptor on success.
It returns -1 on error and prints a diagnostic message on the standard error.
<P>

The
Fn rresvport

function
returns a valid, bound socket descriptor on success.
It returns -1 on error with the global value
<I>errno</I>

set according to the reason for failure.
The error code
<B>EAGAIN</B>

is overloaded to mean ``All network ports in use.''
