<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B>calloc()</B>

allocates memory for an array of 
<I>nmemb</I>

elements of 
<I>size</I>

bytes each and returns a pointer to the allocated memory. 
The memory is set to zero.
<P>

<B>malloc()</B>

allocates
<I>size</I>

bytes and returns a pointer to the allocated memory. 
The memory is not cleared.
<P>

<B>free()</B>

frees the memory space pointed to by
<I>ptr</I>,

which must have been returned by a previous call to
<B>malloc()</B>,

<B>calloc()</B>

or
<B>realloc()</B>.

Otherwise, or if
<B>free(</B><I>ptr</I><B>)</B>

has already been called before, undefined behaviour occurs.
If
<I>ptr</I>

is
<B>NULL</B>,

no operation is performed.
<P>

<B>realloc()</B>

changes the size of the memory block pointed to by
<I>ptr</I>

to
<I>size</I>

bytes.
The contents will be unchanged to the minimum of the old and new sizes;
newly allocated memory will be uninitialized.
If
<I>ptr</I>

is
<B>NULL</B>,

the call is equivalent to
<B>malloc(size)</B>;

if size is equal to zero,
the call is equivalent to
<B>free(</B><I>ptr</I><B>)</B><I>.</I>

Unless
<I>ptr</I>

is
<B>NULL</B>,

it must have been returned by an earlier call to
<B>malloc()</B>,

<B>calloc()</B>

or
<B>realloc()</B>.

If the area pointed to was moved, a
<B>free(</B><I>ptr</I><B>)</B>

is done.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

For
<B>calloc()</B> and <B>malloc()</B>,

the value returned is a pointer to the allocated memory, which is suitably
aligned for any kind of variable, or
<B>NULL</B>

if the request fails.
<P>

<B>free()</B>

returns no value.
<P>

<B>realloc()</B>

returns a pointer to the newly allocated memory, which is suitably
aligned for any kind of variable and may be different from
<I>ptr</I>,

or
<B>NULL</B>

if the request fails. If
<I>size</I>

was equal to 0, either NULL or a pointer suitable to be passed to
<I>free</I>()

is returned.  If
<B>realloc()</B>

fails the original block is left untouched - it is not freed or moved.

<H2>NOTES</H2>

The Unix98 standard requires
<B>malloc()</B>,

<B>calloc()</B>,

and
<B>realloc</B>()

to set
<I>errno</I>

to ENOMEM upon failure. Glibc assumes that this is done
(and the glibc versions of these routines do this); if you
use a private malloc implementation that does not set
<I>errno</I>,

then certain library routines may fail without having
a reason in
<I>errno</I>.

<P>

Crashes in
<B>malloc()</B>,

<B>free()</B>

or
<B>realloc()</B>

are almost always related to heap corruption, such as overflowing
an allocated chunk or freeing the same pointer twice.
<P>

Recent versions of Linux libc (later than 5.4.23) and GNU libc (2.x)
include a malloc implementation which is tunable via environment
variables.  When
<B>MALLOC_CHECK_</B>

is set, a special (less efficient) implementation is used which
is designed to be tolerant against simple errors, such as double
calls of
<B>free()</B>

with the same argument, or overruns of a single byte (off-by-one
bugs).  Not all such errors can be protected against, however, and
memory leaks can result.
If
<B>MALLOC_CHECK_</B>

is set to 0, any detected heap corruption is silently ignored;
if set to 1, a diagnostic is printed on stderr;
if set to 2,
<B>abort()</B>

is called immediately.  This can be useful because otherwise
a crash may happen much later, and the true cause for the problem
is then very hard to track down.
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>BUGS</H2>

By default, Linux follows an optimistic memory allocation strategy.
This means that when
<B>malloc()</B>

returns non-NULL there is no guarantee that the memory really
is available. This is a really bad bug.
In case it turns out that the system is out of memory,
one or more processes will be killed by the infamous OOM killer.
In case Linux is employed under circumstances where it would be
less desirable to suddenly lose some randomly picked processes,
and moreover the kernel version is sufficiently recent,
one can switch off this overcommitting behavior using a command like
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
# echo 2 &gt; /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory
</DL>

See also the kernel Documentation directory, files
<I>vm/overcommit-accounting</I>

and
<I>sysctl/vm.txt</I>.
