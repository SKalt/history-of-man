<A NAME="lbAB">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NAME</H2>

system - execute a shell command
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<PRE>
<B>#include &lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/stdlib.h">stdlib.h</A>&gt;</B>

<B>int system(const char *</B><I>command</I><B>);</B>
</PRE>

<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B>system</B>()

executes a command specified in
<I>command</I>

by calling
<B>/bin/sh -c</B>

<I>command</I>,

and returns after the command has been completed.
During execution of the command,
<B>SIGCHLD</B>

will be blocked, and
<B>SIGINT</B>

and
<B>SIGQUIT</B>

will be ignored.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

The value returned is -1 on error (e.g.,
<B><A HREF="../man2/fork.2.html">fork</A></B>(2)

failed),
and the return status of the command otherwise.
This latter return status is in the format
specified in
<B><A HREF="../man2/wait.2.html">wait</A></B>(2).

Thus, the exit code of the command will be
<I>WEXITSTATUS(status)</I>.

In case
<I>/bin/sh</I>

could not be executed, the exit status will be that of
a command that does
<I>exit(127)</I>.

<P>

If the value of
<I>command</I>

is NULL,
<B>system</B>()

returns nonzero if the shell is available, and zero if not.
<P>

<B>system</B>()

does not affect the wait status of any other children.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>CONFORMING TO</H2>

C89, C99, POSIX.1-2001.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NOTES</H2>

<P>

If the
<B>_XOPEN_SOURCE</B>

feature test macro is defined
(before including
<I>any</I>

header files),
then the macros described in
<B><A HREF="../man2/wait.2.html">wait</A></B>(2)

(<B>WEXITSTATUS</B>(),

etc.) are made available when including
<I>&lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/stdlib.h">stdlib.h</A>&gt;</I>.

<P>

As mentioned,
<B>system</B>()

ignores
<B>SIGINT</B>

and
<B>SIGQUIT</B>.

This may make programs that call it
from a loop uninterruptible, unless they take care themselves
to check the exit status of the child.
E.g.
<BR>

<PRE>

    while (something) {
        int ret = system(&quot;foo&quot;);

        if (WIFSIGNALED(ret) &amp;&amp;
            (WTERMSIG(ret) == SIGINT || WTERMSIG(ret) == SIGQUIT))
                break;
    }
</PRE>

<P>

Do not use
<B>system</B>()

from a program with set-user-ID or set-group-ID privileges,
because strange values for some environment variables
might be used to subvert system integrity.
Use the
<B><A HREF="../man3/exec.3.html">exec</A></B>(3)

family of functions instead, but not
<B><A HREF="../man3/execlp.3.html">execlp</A></B>(3)

or
<B><A HREF="../man3/execvp.3.html">execvp</A></B>(3).

<B>system</B>()

will not, in fact, work properly from programs with set-user-ID or
set-group-ID privileges on systems on which
<I>/bin/sh</I>

is bash version 2, since bash 2 drops privileges on startup.
(Debian uses a modified bash which does not do this when invoked as
<B>sh</B>.)

<P>

In versions of glibc before 2.1.3, the check for the availability of
<I>/bin/sh</I>

was not actually performed if
<I>command</I>

was NULL; instead it was always assumed to be available, and
<B>system</B>()

always returned 1 in this case.
Since glibc 2.1.3, this check is performed because, even though
POSIX.1-2001 requires a conforming implementation to provide
a shell, that shell may not be available or executable if
the calling program has previously called
<B><A HREF="../man2/chroot.2.html">chroot</A></B>(2)

(which is not specified by POSIX.1-2001).
<P>

It is possible for the shell command to return 127, so that code is not
a sure indication that the
<B><A HREF="../man2/execve.2.html">execve</A></B>(2)

call failed.
