tcgetpgrp, tcsetpgrp - get and set terminal foreground process group
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>#include &lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/unistd.h">unistd.h</A>&gt;</B>

<P>
<B>pid_t tcgetpgrp(int </B><I>fd</I><B>);</B>

<P>
<B>int tcsetpgrp(int </B><I>fd</I><B>, pid_t </B><I>pgrp</I><B>);</B>

<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The function
<B>tcgetpgrp</B>()

returns the process group ID of the foreground process group on the
terminal associated to
<I>fd</I>,

which must be the controlling terminal of the calling process.

<P>

The function
<B>tcsetpgrp</B>()

makes the process group with process group ID
<I>pgrp</I>

the foreground process group on the terminal associated to
<I>fd</I>,

which must be the controlling terminal of the calling process,
and still be associated with its session.
Moreover,
<I>pgrp</I>

must be a (nonempty) process group belonging to
the same session as the calling process.
<P>

If
<B>tcsetpgrp</B>()

is called by a member of a background process group in its session,
and the calling process is not blocking or ignoring
<B>SIGTTOU</B>,

a
<B>SIGTTOU</B>

signal is sent to all members of this background process group.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

When
<I>fd</I>

refers to the controlling terminal of the calling process,
the function
<B>tcgetpgrp</B>()

will return the foreground process group ID of that terminal
if there is one, and some value larger than 1 that is not
presently a process group ID otherwise.
When
<I>fd</I>

does not refer to the controlling terminal of the calling process,
-1 is returned, and
<I>errno</I>

is set appropriately.
<P>

When successful,
<B>tcsetpgrp</B>()

returns 0.
Otherwise, it returns -1, and
<I>errno</I>

is set appropriately.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EBADF</B>

<DD>
<I>fd</I>

is not a valid file descriptor.
<DT><B>EINVAL</B>

<DD>
<I>pgrp</I>

has an unsupported value.
<DT><B>ENOTTY</B>

<DD>
The calling process does not have a controlling terminal, or
it has one but it is not described by
<I>fd</I>,

or, for
<B>tcsetpgrp</B>(),

this controlling terminal is no longer associated with the session
of the calling process.
<DT><B>EPERM</B>

<DD>
<I>pgrp</I>

has a supported value, but is not the process group ID of a
process in the same session as the calling process.
