_BSD_SOURCE || (_XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED &amp;&amp; !&nbsp;_XOPEN_SOURCE&nbsp;&gt;=&nbsp;500)

<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The legacy function
<B>ttyslot</B>()

returns the index of the current user's entry in some file.
<P>

Now &quot;What file?&quot; you ask.
Well, let's first look at some history.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Ancient History</H3>

There used to be a file
<I>/etc/ttys</I>

in Unix V6, that was read by the
<B><A HREF="../man8/init.8.html">init</A></B>(8)

program to find out what to do with each terminal line.
Each line consisted of three characters.
The first character was either '0' or '1', where '0' meant &quot;ignore&quot;.
The second character denoted the terminal: '8' stood for &quot;/dev/tty8&quot;.
The third character was an argument to
<B><A HREF="../man8/getty.8.html">getty</A></B>(8)

indicating the sequence of line speeds to try ('-' was: start trying
110 baud).
Thus a typical line was &quot;18-&quot;.
A hang on some line was solved by changing the '1' to a '0',
signaling init, changing back again, and signaling init again.
<P>

In Unix V7 the format was changed: here the second character
was the argument to
<B><A HREF="../man8/getty.8.html">getty</A></B>(8)

indicating the sequence of line speeds to try ('0' was: cycle through
300-1200-150-110 baud; '4' was for the on-line console DECwriter)
while the rest of the line contained the name of the tty.
Thus a typical line was &quot;14console&quot;.
<P>

Later systems have more elaborate syntax.
System V-like systems have
<I>/etc/inittab</I>

instead.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Ancient History (2)</H3>

On the other hand, there is the file
<I>/etc/utmp</I>

listing the people currently logged in.
It is maintained by
<B><A HREF="../man1/login.1.html">login</A></B>(1).

It has a fixed size, and the appropriate index in the file was
determined by
<B><A HREF="../man1/login.1.html">login</A></B>(1)

using the
<B>ttyslot</B>()

call to find the number of the line in
<I>/etc/ttys</I>

(counting from 1).
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>The semantics of ttyslot</H3>

Thus, the function
<B>ttyslot</B>()

returns the index of the controlling terminal of the current process
in the file
<I>/etc/ttys</I>,

and that is (usually) the same as the index of the entry for the
current user in the file
<I>/etc/utmp</I>.

BSD still has the
<I>/etc/ttys</I>

file, but System V-like systems do not, and hence cannot refer to it.
Thus, on such systems the documentation says that
<B>ttyslot</B>()

returns the current user's index in the user accounting data base.
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

If successful, this function returns the slot number.
On error (e.g., if none of the file descriptors 0, 1 or 2 is
associated with a terminal that occurs in this data base)
it returns 0 on Unix V6 and V7 and BSD-like systems,
but -1 on System V-like systems.
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>CONFORMING TO</H2>

SUSv1; marked as LEGACY in SUSv2; removed in POSIX.1-2001.
SUSv2 requires -1 on error.
<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NOTES</H2>

The utmp file is found various places on various systems, such as
<I>/etc/utmp</I>,

<I>/var/adm/utmp</I>,

<I>/var/run/utmp</I>.

<P>

The glibc2 implementation of this function reads the file
<B>_PATH_TTYS</B>,

defined in
<I>&lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/ttyent.h">ttyent.h</A>&gt;</I>

as &quot;/etc/ttys&quot;.
It returns 0 on error.
Since Linux systems do not usually have &quot;/etc/ttys&quot;, it will
always return 0.
<P>

Minix also has
<I>fttyslot</I>(<I>fd</I>).
