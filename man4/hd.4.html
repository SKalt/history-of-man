hd - MFM/IDE hard disk devices
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The
<B>hd*</B>

devices are block devices to access MFM/IDE hard disk drives
in raw mode.
The master drive on the primary IDE controller (major device
number 3) is
<B>hda</B>;

the slave drive is
<B>hdb</B>.

The master drive of the second controller (major device number 22)
is
<B>hdc</B>

and the slave
<B>hdd</B>.

<P>

General IDE block device names have the form
<B>hd</B><I>X</I>, or
<B>hd</B><I>XP</I>, where
<I>X</I>

is a letter denoting the physical drive, and
<I>P</I>

is a number denoting the partition on that physical drive.
The first form,
<B>hd</B><I>X,</I>

is used to address the whole drive.
Partition numbers are assigned in the order the partitions
are discovered, and only nonempty, nonextended partitions
get a number.
However, partition numbers 1-4 are given to the
four partitions described in the MBR (the &quot;primary&quot; partitions),
regardless of whether they are unused or extended.
Thus, the first logical partition will be
<B>hd</B><I>X</I><B>5</B>.
Both DOS-type partitioning and BSD-disklabel partitioning are supported.
You can have at most 63 partitions on an IDE disk.
<P>

For example,
<I>/dev/hda</I>

refers to all of the first IDE drive in the system; and
<I>/dev/hdb3</I>

refers to the third DOS &quot;primary&quot; partition on the second one.
