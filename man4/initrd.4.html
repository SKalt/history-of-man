initrd - boot loader initialized RAM disk
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The special file
<I>/dev/initrd</I>

is a read-only block device.
Device
<I>/dev/initrd</I>

is a RAM disk that is initialized (e.g., loaded) by the boot loader before
the kernel is started.
The kernel then can use the block device
<I>/dev/initrd</I>'s 

contents for a two phased system boot-up.
<P>

In the first boot-up phase, the kernel starts up
and mounts an initial root file-system from the contents
of
<I>/dev/initrd</I>

(e.g. RAM disk initialized by the boot loader).
In the second phase, additional drivers or other modules
are loaded from the initial root device's contents.
After loading the additional modules, a new root file system
(i.e., the normal root file system) is mounted from a
different device.



<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Boot-up Operation</H3>

When booting up with
<B>initrd</B>, the system boots as follows:

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>1.<DD>
The boot loader loads the kernel program and
<I>/dev/initrd</I>'s contents into memory.

IP 2.
On kernel startup,
the kernel uncompresses and copies the contents of the device
<I>/dev/initrd</I>

onto device
<I>/dev/ram0</I>

and then frees the memory used by
<I>/dev/initrd</I>.

<DT>3.<DD>
The kernel then read-write mounts device
<I>/dev/ram0</I>

as the initial root file system.
<DT>4.<DD>
If the indicated normal root file system is also the initial root file-system
(e.g.
<I>/dev/ram0</I>

) then the kernel skips to the last step for the usual boot sequence.
<DT>5.<DD>
If the executable file
<I>/linuxrc</I> is present in the initial root file-system, <I>/linuxrc</I>

is executed with UID 0.
(The file
<I>/linuxrc</I>

must have executable permission.
The file
<I>/linuxrc</I>

can be any valid executable, including a shell script.)
<DT>6.<DD>
If
<I>/linuxrc</I>

is not executed or when
<I>/linuxrc</I>

terminates, the normal root file system is mounted.
(If
<I>/linuxrc</I>

exits with any file-systems mounted on the initial root
file-system, then the behavior of the kernel is
<B>UNSPECIFIED</B>.

See the
<B>NOTES</B>

section for the current kernel behavior.)
<DT>7.<DD>
If the normal root file has directory
<I>/initrd</I>, device

<I>/dev/ram0</I>

is moved from
<I>/</I> to <I>/initrd</I>.

Otherwise if directory
<I>/initrd</I> does not exist device <I>/dev/ram0</I> is unmounted.

(When moved from
<I>/</I> to <I>/initrd</I>, <I>/dev/ram0</I>

is not unmounted and therefore processes can remain running from
<I>/dev/ram0</I>.

If directory
<I>/initrd</I>

does not exist on the normal root file-system
and any processes remain running from
<I>/dev/ram0</I> when <I>/linuxrc</I>

exits, the behavior of the kernel is
<B>UNSPECIFIED</B>.

See the
<B>NOTES</B>

section for the current kernel behavior.)
<DT>8.<DD>
The usual boot sequence (e.g. invocation of
<I>/sbin/init</I>)

is performed on the normal root file system.



</DL>
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Options</H3>

The following boot loader options when used with
<B>initrd</B>, affect the kernel's boot-up operation:

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>initrd=</B><I>filename</I>

<DD>
Specifies the file to load as the contents of
<I>/dev/initrd</I>.

For
<B>LOADLIN</B>

this is a command line option.
For
<B>LILO</B>

you have to use this command in the
<B>LILO</B>

configuration file
<I>/etc/lilo.config</I>.

The filename specified with this
option will typically be a gzipped file-system image.
<DT><I>noinitrd</I>

<DD>
This boot time option disables the two phase boot-up operation.
The kernel performs the usual boot sequence as if
<I>/dev/initrd</I>

was not initialized.
With this option, any contents of
<I>/dev/initrd</I>

loaded into memory by the boot loader contents are preserved.
This option permits the contents of
<I>/dev/initrd</I>

to be any data and need not be limited to a file system image.
However, device
<I>/dev/initrd</I>

is read-only and can be read only one time after system startup.
<DT><B>root=</B><I>device-name</I>

<DD>
Specifies the device to be used as the normal root file system.
For <B>LOADLIN</B>

this is a command line option.
For <B>LILO</B> this is a boot time option or

can be used as an option line in the
<B>LILO</B> configuration file <B>/etc/lilo.config</B>.

The device specified by the this option must be a mountable
device having a suitable root file-system.



</DL>
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Changing the Normal Root File System</H3>

By default,
the kernel's settings
(e.g. set in the kernel file with
<B><A HREF="../man8/rdev.8.html">rdev</A></B>(8)

or compiled into the kernel file),
or the boot loader option setting
is used for the normal root file systems.
For a NFS-mounted normal root file system, one has to use the
<B>nfs_root_name</B> and <B>nfs_root_addrs</B>

boot options to give the NFS settings.
For more information on NFS-mounted root see the kernel documentation file
<B>nfsroot.txt</B>.

For more information on setting the root file system also see the
<B>LILO</B> and <B>LOADLIN</B> documentation.

<P>

It is also possible for the
<I>/linuxrc</I>

executable to change the normal root device.
For
<I>/linuxrc</I>

to change the normal root device,
<I>/proc</I> must be mounted.

After mounting
<I>/proc</I>, <I>/linuxrc</I>

changes the normal root device by writing into the proc files
<I>/proc/sys/kernel/real-root-dev</I>, 

<I>/proc/sys/kernel/nfs-root-name</I>, and 

<I>/proc/sys/kernel/nfs-root-addrs</I>.

For a physical root device, the root device is changed by having
<I>/linuxrc</I>

write the new root file system device number into
<I>/proc/sys/kernel/real-root-dev</I>.

For a NFS root file system, the root device is changed by having
<I>/linuxrc</I>

write the NFS setting into files
<I>/proc/sys/kernel/nfs-root-name</I> and 

<I>/proc/sys/kernel/nfs-root-addrs</I>

and then writing 0xff (e.g. the pseudo-NFS-device number) into file
<I>/proc/sys/kernel/real-root-dev</I>.

For example, the following shell command line would change
the normal root device to
<I>/dev/hdb1</I>:

<PRE>

    echo 0x365 &gt;/proc/sys/kernel/real-root-dev

</PRE>

For a NFS example, the following shell command lines would change the
normal root device to the NFS directory
<I>/var/nfsroot</I>

on a local networked NFS server with IP number 193.8.232.7 for a system with
IP number 193.8.232.7 and named 'idefix':
<PRE>

    echo /var/nfsroot &gt;/proc/sys/kernel/nfs-root-name
    echo 193.8.232.2:193.8.232.7::255.255.255.0:idefix \
        &gt;/proc/sys/kernel/nfs-root-addrs
    echo 255 &gt;/proc/sys/kernel/real-root-dev
</PRE>

<P>
<B>Note</B>:

The use of
<I>/proc/sys/kernel/real-root-dev</I>

to change the root file system is obsolete.
See the kernel source file
<I>Documentation/initrd.txt</I>

as well as
<B><A HREF="../man2/pivot_root.2.html">pivot_root</A></B>(2)

and
<B><A HREF="../man8/pivot_root.8.html">pivot_root</A></B>(8)

for information on the modern method of changing the root file system.




<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Usage</H3>

The main motivation for implementing
<B>initrd</B>

was to allow for modular kernel configuration at system installation.
<P>

A possible system installation scenario is as follows:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>1.<DD>
The loader program boots from floppy or other media with a minimal kernel
(e.g. support for
<I>/dev/ram</I>, <I>/dev/initrd</I>, and the ext2 file-system) and loads 

<I>/dev/initrd</I> with a gzipped version of the initial file-system.

<DT>2.<DD>
The executable
<I>/linuxrc</I>

determines what is needed to (1) mount the normal root file-system
(i.e., device type, device drivers, file system) and (2) the
distribution media (e.g. CD-ROM, network, tape, ...).
This can be
done by asking the user, by auto-probing, or by using a hybrid
approach.
<DT>3.<DD>
The executable
<I>/linuxrc</I>

loads the necessary modules from the initial root file-system.
<DT>4.<DD>
The executable
<I>/linuxrc</I>

creates and populates the root file system.
(At this stage the normal root file system does not have to be a
completed system yet.)
<DT>5.<DD>
The executable
<I>/linuxrc</I> sets <I>/proc/sys/kernel/real-root-dev,</I>

unmount
<I>/proc</I>, 

the normal root file system and any other file
systems it has mounted, and then terminates.
</DL>
<P>

6. The kernel then mounts the normal root file system.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>7.<DD>
Now that the file system is accessible and intact,
the boot loader can be installed.
<DT>8.<DD>
The boot loader is configured to load into
<I>/dev/initrd</I>

a file system with the set of modules that was used to bring up the system.
(e.g. Device
<I>/dev/ram0</I>

can be modified, then unmounted, and finally, the image is written from
<I>/dev/ram0</I>

to a file.)
<DT>9.<DD>
The system is now bootable and additional installation tasks can be
performed.
</DL>
<P>

The key role of
<I>/dev/initrd</I>

in the above is to re-use the configuration data during normal system operation
without requiring initial kernel selection, a large generic kernel or,
recompiling the kernel.
<P>

A second scenario is for installations where Linux runs on systems with
different hardware configurations in a single administrative network.
In such cases, it may be desirable to use only a small set of kernels
(ideally only one) and to keep the system-specific part of configuration
information as small as possible.
In this case, create a common file
with all needed modules.
Then, only the
<I>/linuxrc</I>

file or a file executed by
<I>/linuxrc</I>

would be different.
<P>

A third scenario is more convenient recovery disks.
Because information like the location of the root file-system
partition is not needed at boot time, the system loaded from
<I>/dev/initrd</I>

can use a dialog and/or auto-detection followed by a
possible sanity check.
<P>

Last but not least, Linux distributions on CD-ROM may use
<B>initrd</B>

for easy installation from the CD-ROM.
The distribution can use
<B>LOADLIN</B>

to directly load
<I>/dev/initrd</I>

from CD-ROM without the need of any floppies.
The distribution could also use a
<B>LILO</B>

boot floppy and then bootstrap a bigger ram disk via
<I>/dev/initrd</I> from the CD-ROM.




<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Configuration</H3>

The
<I>/dev/initrd</I>

is a read-only block device assigned
major number 1 and minor number 250.
Typically
<I>/dev/initrd</I>

is owned by
<I>root.disk</I>

with mode 0400 (read access by root only).
If the Linux system does not have
<I>/dev/initrd</I>

already created, it can be created with the following commands:
<PRE>
<B>
        mknod -m 400 /dev/initrd b 1 250
        chown root:disk /dev/initrd
</B>
</PRE>

<P>

Also, support for both &quot;RAM disk&quot; and &quot;Initial RAM disk&quot;
(e.g.
<B>CONFIG_BLK_DEV_RAM=y</B> and <B>CONFIG_BLK_DEV_INITRD=y</B>

) support must be compiled directly into the Linux kernel to use
<I>/dev/initrd</I>.

When using
<I>/dev/initrd</I>, 

the RAM disk driver cannot be loaded as a module.

<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NOTES</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>1.<DD>
With the current kernel, any file systems that remain mounted when
<I>/dev/ram0</I> is moved from <I>/</I> to <I>/initrd</I>

continue to be accessible.
However, the
<I>/proc/mounts</I>

entries are not updated.
<DT>2.<DD>
With the current kernel, if directory
<I>/initrd</I> does not exist, then 

<I>/dev/ram0</I>

will NOT be fully unmounted if
<I>/dev/ram0</I>

is used by any process or has any file-system mounted on it.
If
<I>/dev/ram0</I> is NOT fully unmounted, 

then
<I>/dev/ram0</I>

will remain in memory.
<DT>3.<DD>
Users of
<I>/dev/initrd</I>

should not depend on the behavior give in the above notes.
The behavior may change in future versions of the Linux kernel.
