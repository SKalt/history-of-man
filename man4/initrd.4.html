initrd - boot loader initialized RAM disk
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>CONFIGURATION</H2>

The
<I>/dev/initrd</I>

is a read-only block device assigned
major number 1 and minor number 250.
Typically
<I>/dev/initrd</I>

is owned by
<I>root.disk</I>

with mode 0400 (read access by root only).
If the Linux system does not have
<I>/dev/initrd</I>

already created, it can be created with the following commands:
<PRE>
<B>
        mknod -m 400 /dev/initrd b 1 250
        chown root:disk /dev/initrd
</B>
</PRE>

<P>

Also, support for both &quot;RAM disk&quot; and &quot;Initial RAM disk&quot;
(e.g.,
<B>CONFIG_BLK_DEV_RAM=y</B>

and
<B>CONFIG_BLK_DEV_INITRD=y</B>)

must be compiled directly into the Linux kernel to use
<I>/dev/initrd</I>.

When using
<I>/dev/initrd</I>,

the RAM disk driver cannot be loaded as a module.



<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The special file
<I>/dev/initrd</I>

is a read-only block device.
This device is a RAM disk that is initialized (e.g., loaded)
by the boot loader before the kernel is started.
The kernel then can use
<I>/dev/initrd</I>'s 

contents for a two-phase system boot-up.
<P>

In the first boot-up phase, the kernel starts up
and mounts an initial root filesystem from the contents of
<I>/dev/initrd</I>

(e.g., RAM disk initialized by the boot loader).
In the second phase, additional drivers or other modules
are loaded from the initial root device's contents.
After loading the additional modules, a new root filesystem
(i.e., the normal root filesystem) is mounted from a
different device.



<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Boot-up operation</H3>

When booting up with
<B>initrd</B>,

the system boots as follows:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>1.<DD>
The boot loader loads the kernel program and
<I>/dev/initrd</I>'s

contents into memory.
<DT>2.<DD>
On kernel startup,
the kernel uncompresses and copies the contents of the device
<I>/dev/initrd</I>

onto device
<I>/dev/ram0</I>

and then frees the memory used by
<I>/dev/initrd</I>.

<DT>3.<DD>
The kernel then read-write mounts the device
<I>/dev/ram0</I>

as the initial root filesystem.
<DT>4.<DD>
If the indicated normal root filesystem is also the initial
root filesystem (e.g.,
<I>/dev/ram0</I>)

then the kernel skips to the last step for the usual boot sequence.
<DT>5.<DD>
If the executable file
<I>/linuxrc</I>

is present in the initial root filesystem,
<I>/linuxrc</I>

is executed with UID 0.
(The file
<I>/linuxrc</I>

must have executable permission.
The file
<I>/linuxrc</I>

can be any valid executable, including a shell script.)
<DT>6.<DD>
If
<I>/linuxrc</I>

is not executed or when
<I>/linuxrc</I>

terminates, the normal root filesystem is mounted.
(If
<I>/linuxrc</I>

exits with any filesystems mounted on the initial root
filesystem, then the behavior of the kernel is
<B>UNSPECIFIED</B>.

See the NOTES section for the current kernel behavior.)
<DT>7.<DD>
If the normal root filesystem has a directory
<I>/initrd</I>,

the device
<I>/dev/ram0</I>

is moved from
<I>/</I>

to
<I>/initrd</I>.

Otherwise, if the directory
<I>/initrd</I>

does not exist, the device
<I>/dev/ram0</I>

is unmounted.
(When moved from
<I>/</I>

to
<I>/initrd</I>,

<I>/dev/ram0</I>

is not unmounted and therefore processes can remain running from
<I>/dev/ram0</I>.

If directory
<I>/initrd</I>

does not exist on the normal root filesystem
and any processes remain running from
<I>/dev/ram0</I>

when
<I>/linuxrc</I>

exits, the behavior of the kernel is
<B>UNSPECIFIED</B>.

See the NOTES section for the current kernel behavior.)
<DT>8.<DD>
The usual boot sequence (e.g., invocation of
<I>/sbin/init</I>)

is performed on the normal root filesystem.



</DL>
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Options</H3>

The following boot loader options, when used with
<B>initrd</B>,

affect the kernel's boot-up operation:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>initrd=</B><I>filename</I>

<DD>
Specifies the file to load as the contents of
<I>/dev/initrd</I>.

For
<B>LOADLIN</B>

this is a command-line option.
For
<B>LILO</B>

you have to use this command in the
<B>LILO</B>

configuration file
<I>/etc/lilo.config</I>.

The filename specified with this
option will typically be a gzipped filesystem image.
<DT><I>noinitrd</I>

<DD>
This boot option disables the two-phase boot-up operation.
The kernel performs the usual boot sequence as if
<I>/dev/initrd</I>

was not initialized.
With this option, any contents of
<I>/dev/initrd</I>

loaded into memory by the boot loader contents are preserved.
This option permits the contents of
<I>/dev/initrd</I>

to be any data and need not be limited to a filesystem image.
However, device
<I>/dev/initrd</I>

is read-only and can be read only one time after system startup.
<DT><B>root=</B><I>device-name</I>

<DD>
Specifies the device to be used as the normal root filesystem.
For
<B>LOADLIN</B>

this is a command-line option.
For
<B>LILO</B>

this is a boot time option or
can be used as an option line in the
<B>LILO</B>

configuration file
<I>/etc/lilo.config</I>.

The device specified by the this option must be a mountable
device having a suitable root filesystem.



</DL>
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Changing the normal root filesystem</H3>

By default,
the kernel's settings
(e.g., set in the kernel file with
<B><A HREF="../man8/rdev.8.html">rdev</A></B>(8)

or compiled into the kernel file),
or the boot loader option setting
is used for the normal root filesystems.
For an NFS-mounted normal root filesystem, one has to use the
<B>nfs_root_name</B>

and
<B>nfs_root_addrs</B>

boot options to give the NFS settings.
For more information on NFS-mounted root see the kernel documentation file
<B>Documentation/filesystems/nfsroot.txt</B>.

For more information on setting the root filesystem see also the
<B>LILO</B>

and
<B>LOADLIN</B>

documentation.
<P>

It is also possible for the
<I>/linuxrc</I>

executable to change the normal root device.
For
<I>/linuxrc</I>

to change the normal root device,
<I>/proc</I>

must be mounted.
After mounting
<I>/proc</I>,

<I>/linuxrc</I>

changes the normal root device by writing into the proc files
<I>/proc/sys/kernel/real-root-dev</I>,

<I>/proc/sys/kernel/nfs-root-name</I>,

and
<I>/proc/sys/kernel/nfs-root-addrs</I>.

For a physical root device, the root device is changed by having
<I>/linuxrc</I>

write the new root filesystem device number into
<I>/proc/sys/kernel/real-root-dev</I>.

For an NFS root filesystem, the root device is changed by having
<I>/linuxrc</I>

write the NFS setting into files
<I>/proc/sys/kernel/nfs-root-name</I>

and
<I>/proc/sys/kernel/nfs-root-addrs</I>

and then writing 0xff (e.g., the pseudo-NFS-device number) into file
<I>/proc/sys/kernel/real-root-dev</I>.

For example, the following shell command line would change
the normal root device to
<I>/dev/hdb1</I>:

<PRE>

    echo 0x365 &gt;/proc/sys/kernel/real-root-dev

</PRE>

For an NFS example, the following shell command lines would change the
normal root device to the NFS directory
<I>/var/nfsroot</I>

on a local networked NFS server with IP number 193.8.232.7 for a system with
IP number 193.8.232.2 and named &quot;idefix&quot;:
<PRE>

    echo /var/nfsroot &gt;/proc/sys/kernel/nfs-root-name
    echo 193.8.232.2:193.8.232.7::255.255.255.0:idefix \
        &gt;/proc/sys/kernel/nfs-root-addrs
    echo 255 &gt;/proc/sys/kernel/real-root-dev
</PRE>

<P>
<B>Note</B>:

The use of
<I>/proc/sys/kernel/real-root-dev</I>

to change the root filesystem is obsolete.
See the Linux kernel source file
<I>Documentation/initrd.txt</I>

as well as
<B><A HREF="../man2/pivot_root.2.html">pivot_root</A></B>(2)

and
<B><A HREF="../man8/pivot_root.8.html">pivot_root</A></B>(8)

for information on the modern method of changing the root filesystem.




<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Usage</H3>

The main motivation for implementing
<B>initrd</B>

was to allow for modular kernel configuration at system installation.
<P>

A possible system installation scenario is as follows:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>1.<DD>
The loader program boots from floppy or other media with a minimal kernel
(e.g., support for
<I>/dev/ram</I>,

<I>/dev/initrd</I>,

and the ext2 filesystem) and loads
<I>/dev/initrd</I>

with a gzipped version of the initial filesystem.
<DT>2.<DD>
The executable
<I>/linuxrc</I>

determines what is needed to (1) mount the normal root filesystem
(i.e., device type, device drivers, filesystem) and (2) the
distribution media (e.g., CD-ROM, network, tape, ...).
This can be done by asking the user, by auto-probing,
or by using a hybrid approach.
<DT>3.<DD>
The executable
<I>/linuxrc</I>

loads the necessary modules from the initial root filesystem.
<DT>4.<DD>
The executable
<I>/linuxrc</I>

creates and populates the root filesystem.
(At this stage the normal root filesystem does not have to be a
completed system yet.)
<DT>5.<DD>
The executable
<I>/linuxrc</I>

sets
<I>/proc/sys/kernel/real-root-dev</I>,

unmount
<I>/proc</I>,

the normal root filesystem and any other filesystems
it has mounted, and then terminates.
<DT>6.<DD>
The kernel then mounts the normal root filesystem.
<DT>7.<DD>
Now that the filesystem is accessible and intact,
the boot loader can be installed.
<DT>8.<DD>
The boot loader is configured to load into
<I>/dev/initrd</I>

a filesystem with the set of modules that was used to bring up the system.
(e.g., Device
<I>/dev/ram0</I>

can be modified, then unmounted, and finally, the image is written from
<I>/dev/ram0</I>

to a file.)
<DT>9.<DD>
The system is now bootable and additional installation tasks can be
performed.
</DL>
<P>

The key role of
<I>/dev/initrd</I>

in the above is to reuse the configuration data during normal system operation
without requiring initial kernel selection, a large generic kernel or,
recompiling the kernel.
<P>

A second scenario is for installations where Linux runs on systems with
different hardware configurations in a single administrative network.
In such cases, it may be desirable to use only a small set of kernels
(ideally only one) and to keep the system-specific part of configuration
information as small as possible.
In this case, create a common file
with all needed modules.
Then, only the
<I>/linuxrc</I>

file or a file executed by
<I>/linuxrc</I>

would be different.
<P>

A third scenario is more convenient recovery disks.
Because information like the location of the root filesystem
partition is not needed at boot time, the system loaded from
<I>/dev/initrd</I>

can use a dialog and/or auto-detection followed by a
possible sanity check.
<P>

Last but not least, Linux distributions on CD-ROM may use
<B>initrd</B>

for easy installation from the CD-ROM.
The distribution can use
<B>LOADLIN</B>

to directly load
<I>/dev/initrd</I>

from CD-ROM without the need of any floppies.
The distribution could also use a
<B>LILO</B>

boot floppy and then bootstrap a bigger RAM disk via
<I>/dev/initrd</I>

from the CD-ROM.

<H2>NOTES</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>1.<DD>
With the current kernel, any filesystems that remain mounted when
<I>/dev/ram0</I>

is moved from
<I>/</I>

to
<I>/initrd</I>

continue to be accessible.
However, the
<I>/proc/mounts</I>

entries are not updated.
<DT>2.<DD>
With the current kernel, if directory
<I>/initrd</I>

does not exist, then
<I>/dev/ram0</I>

will
<B>not</B>

be fully unmounted if
<I>/dev/ram0</I>

is used by any process or has any filesystem mounted on it.
If
<I>/dev/ram0</I>

is
<B>not</B>

fully unmounted, then
<I>/dev/ram0</I>

will remain in memory.
<DT>3.<DD>
Users of
<I>/dev/initrd</I>

should not depend on the behavior give in the above notes.
The behavior may change in future versions of the Linux kernel.
