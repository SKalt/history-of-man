<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<I>/dev/mem</I>

is a character device file
that is an image of the main memory of the computer.
It may be used, for example, to examine (and even patch) the system.
<P>

Byte addresses in
<I>/dev/mem</I>

are interpreted as physical memory addresses.
References to nonexistent locations cause errors to be returned.
<P>

Examining and patching is likely to lead to unexpected results
when read-only or write-only bits are present.
<P>

Since Linux 2.6.26, and depending on the architecture, the
<B>CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM</B>

kernel configuration option limits the areas
which can be accessed through this file.
For example: on x86, RAM access is not allowed but accessing
memory-mapped PCI regions is.
<P>

It is typically created by:
<P>



mknod -m 660 /dev/mem c 1 1
chown root:kmem /dev/mem


<P>

The file
<I>/dev/kmem</I>

is the same as
<I>/dev/mem</I>,

except that the kernel virtual memory
rather than physical memory is accessed.
Since Linux 2.6.26, this file is available only if the
<B>CONFIG_DEVKMEM</B>

kernel configuration option is enabled.
<P>

It is typically created by:
<P>



mknod -m 640 /dev/kmem c 1 2
chown root:kmem /dev/kmem


<P>

<I>/dev/port</I>

is similar to
<I>/dev/mem</I>,

but the I/O ports are accessed.
<P>

It is typically created by:
<P>



mknod -m 660 /dev/port c 1 4
chown root:kmem /dev/port
