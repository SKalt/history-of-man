null, zero - data sink
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

Data written to the
<I>/dev/null</I>

and
<I>/dev/zero</I>

special files is discarded.
<P>

Reads from
<I>/dev/null</I>

always return end of file (i.e.,
<B><A HREF="../man2/read.2.html">read</A></B>(2)

returns 0), whereas reads from
<I>/dev/zero</I>

always return bytes containing zero ('\0' characters).
<P>

These devices are typically created by:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>
mknod -m 666 /dev/null c 1 3
<BR>

mknod -m 666 /dev/zero c 1 5
<BR>

chown root:root /dev/null /dev/zero
</DL>

<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>FILES</H2>

<I>/dev/null</I>

<BR>

<I>/dev/zero</I>

<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NOTES</H2>

If these devices are not writable and readable for all users, many
programs will act strangely.
<P>
Since Linux 2.6.31,

reads from
<I>/dev/zero</I>

are interruptible by signals.
(This change was made to help with bad latencies for large reads from
<I>/dev/zero</I>.)
