<H2>NAME</H2>

sd - driver for SCSI disk drives
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<PRE>
<B>#include &lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/linux/hdreg.h">linux/hdreg.h</A>&gt;        </B>/* for HDIO_GETGEO */
<B>#include &lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/linux/fs.h">linux/fs.h</A>&gt;           </B>/* for BLKGETSIZE and BLKRRPART */
</PRE>

<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>CONFIGURATION</H2>

The block device name has the following form:
<B>sd</B><I>lp,</I>

where
<I>l</I>

is a letter denoting the physical drive, and
<I>p</I>

is a number denoting the partition on that physical drive.
Often, the partition number,
<I>p</I>,

will be left off when the device corresponds to the whole drive.
<P>
SCSI disks have a major device number of 8, and a minor device number of
the form (16 *
<I>drive_number</I>) + <I>partition_number</I>,

where
<I>drive_number</I>

is the number of the physical drive in order of detection, and
<I>partition_number</I>

is as follows:
<P>
partition 0 is the whole drive
<BR>

partitions 1-4 are the DOS &quot;primary&quot; partitions
<BR>

partitions 5-8 are the DOS &quot;extended&quot; (or &quot;logical&quot;) partitions
<P>
For example,
<I>/dev/sda</I>

will have major 8, minor 0, and will refer to all of the first SCSI drive
in the system; and
<I>/dev/sdb3</I>

will have major 8, minor 19, and will refer to the third DOS &quot;primary&quot;
partition on the second SCSI drive in the system.
<P>
At this time, only block devices are provided.
Raw devices have not yet been implemented.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The following
<I>ioctl</I>s

are provided:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>HDIO_GETGEO</B>

<DD>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Returns the BIOS disk parameters in the following structure:

<PRE>

struct hd_geometry {
    unsigned char  heads;
    unsigned char  sectors;
    unsigned short cylinders;
    unsigned long  start;
};
</PRE>


<P>
A pointer to this structure is passed as the
<B><A HREF="../man2/ioctl.2.html">ioctl</A></B>(2)

parameter.
<P>
The information returned in the parameter is the disk geometry of the drive
<I>as understood by DOS!</I>

This geometry is
<I>not</I>

the physical geometry of the drive.
It is used when constructing the
drive's partition table, however, and is needed for convenient operation
of
<B><A HREF="../man1/fdisk.1.html">fdisk</A></B>(1),

<B><A HREF="../man1/efdisk.1.html">efdisk</A></B>(1),

and
<B><A HREF="../man1/lilo.1.html">lilo</A></B>(1).

If the geometry information is not available, zero will be returned for all
of the parameters.
</DL>

<DT><B>BLKGETSIZE</B>

<DD>
Returns the device size in sectors.
The
<B><A HREF="../man2/ioctl.2.html">ioctl</A></B>(2)

parameter should be a pointer to a
<I>long</I>.

<DT><B>BLKRRPART</B>

<DD>
Forces a reread of the SCSI disk partition tables.
No parameter is needed.
<P>
The SCSI
<B><A HREF="../man2/ioctl.2.html">ioctl</A></B>(2)

operations are also supported.
If the
<B><A HREF="../man2/ioctl.2.html">ioctl</A></B>(2)

parameter is required, and it is NULL, then
<B><A HREF="../man2/ioctl.2.html">ioctl</A></B>(2)

will fail with the error
<B>EINVAL</B>.
