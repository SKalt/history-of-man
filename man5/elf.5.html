<H2>NAME</H2>

elf - format of Executable and Linking Format (ELF) files
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<PRE>
<B>#include &lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/elf.h">elf.h</A>&gt;</B>
</PRE>

<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The header file
<I>&lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/elf.h">elf.h</A>&gt;</I>

defines the format of ELF executable binary files.
Amongst these files are
normal executable files, relocatable object files, core files and shared
libraries.
<P>

An executable file using the ELF file format consists of an ELF header,
followed by a program header table or a section header table, or both.
The ELF header is always at offset zero of the file.
The program header
table and the section header table's offset in the file are defined in the
ELF header.
The two tables describe the rest of the particularities of
the file.
<P>
























This header file describes the above mentioned headers as C structures
and also includes structures for dynamic sections, relocation sections and
symbol tables.
<P>

The following types are used for N-bit architectures (N=32,64,
<I>ElfN</I>

stands for
<I>Elf32</I>

or
<I>Elf64</I>,

<I>uintN_t</I>

stands for
<I>uint32_t</I>

or
<I>uint64_t</I>):


<PRE>

ElfN_Addr       Unsigned program address, uintN_t
ElfN_Off        Unsigned file offset, uintN_t
ElfN_Section    Unsigned section index, uint16_t
ElfN_Versym     Unsigned version symbol information, uint16_t
Elf_Byte        unsigned char
ElfN_Half       uint16_t
ElfN_Sword      int32_t
ElfN_Word       uint32_t
ElfN_Sxword     int64_t
ElfN_Xword      uint64_t
</PRE>


<P>

(Note: The *BSD terminology is a bit different.
There
<I>Elf64_Half</I>

is
twice as large as
<I>Elf32_Half</I>,

and
<I>Elf64Quarter</I>

is used for
<I>uint16_t</I>.

In order to avoid confusion these types are replaced by explicit ones
in the below.)
<P>

All data structures that the file format defines follow the
&quot;natural&quot;
size and alignment guidelines for the relevant class.
If necessary,
data structures contain explicit padding to ensure 4-byte alignment
for 4-byte objects, to force structure sizes to a multiple of 4, and so on.
<P>

The ELF header is described by the type
<I>Elf32_Ehdr</I>

or
<I>Elf64_Ehdr</I>:


<PRE>

#define EI_NIDENT 16

typedef struct {
    unsigned char e_ident[EI_NIDENT];
    uint16_t      e_type;
    uint16_t      e_machine;
    uint32_t      e_version;
    ElfN_Addr     e_entry;
    ElfN_Off      e_phoff;
    ElfN_Off      e_shoff;
    uint32_t      e_flags;

<P>

The fields have the following meanings:

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><I>e_ident</I>

<DD>
This array of bytes specifies to interpret the file,
independent of the processor or the file's remaining contents.
Within this array everything is named by macros, which start with
the prefix
<B>EI_</B>

and may contain values which start with the prefix
<B>ELF</B>.

The following macros are defined:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>

The second byte of the magic number.
It must be filled with
<B>ELFMAG1</B>.

(1: 'E')
<DT><B>EI_MAG2</B>

<DD>
The third byte of the magic number.
It must be filled with
<B>ELFMAG2</B>.

<DT>
<DD>
<B>ELFDATANONE</B>

Unknown data format.
<DT><B>ELFDATA2LSB</B>

<DD>

</DL>
</DL>


<DT><B>EI_OSABI</B>

<DD>
The eighth byte identifies the operating system
and ABI to which the object is targeted.
Some fields in other ELF structures have flags
and values that have platform-specific meanings;
the interpretation of those fields is determined by the value of this byte.

to which the object is targeted.
This field is used to distinguish among incompatible versions of an ABI.
The interpretation of this version number
is dependent on the ABI identified by the
<B>EI_OSABI</B>

field.
Applications conforming to this specification use the value 0.
<DT><B>EI_PAD</B>

<DD>
Start of padding.
These bytes are reserved and set to zero.

This member holds the program header table's file offset in bytes.
If
the file has no program header table, this member holds zero.

table; all entries are the same size.
<DT><I>e_phnum</I>

<DD>
This member holds the number of entries in the program header
table.
Thus the product of
<I>e_phentsize</I>

and
<I>e_phnum</I>

gives the table's size
in bytes.
If a file has no program header,
<I>e_phnum</I>

holds the value zero.
<DT><DD>
If the number of entries in the program header table is larger than or equal to

<B>PN_XNUM</B>

(0xffff), this member holds
<B>PN_XNUM</B>

(0xffff) and the real number of entries in the program header table is held
in the
<I>sh_info</I>

member of the initial entry in section header table.
Otherwise, the
<I>sh_info</I>

member of the initial entry contains the value zero.

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>PN_XNUM</B>

<DD>
This is defined as 0xffff, the largest number
<I>e_phnum</I>

</DL>
</DL>


<DT><DD>
<DT><I>e_shentsize</I>

<DD>
This member holds a sections header's size in bytes.
A section header is one
entry in the section header table; all entries are the same size.
<DT><I>e_shnum</I>

<DD>
This member holds the number of entries in the section header table.
Thus
the product of
<I>e_shentsize</I>

and
<I>e_shnum</I>

gives the section header table's size in bytes.
If a file has no section
header table,
<I>e_shnum</I>

holds the value of zero.
<DT><DD>
If the number of entries in the section header table is larger than or equal to
<B>SHN_LORESERVE</B>

(0xff00),
<I>e_shnum</I>

holds the value zero and the real number of entries in the section header
table is held in the
<I>sh_size</I>

member of the initial entry in section header table.
Otherwise, the
<I>sh_size</I>

member of the initial entry in the section header table holds the value zero.
<DT><I>e_shstrndx</I>

<DD>
This member holds the section header table index of the entry associated
with the section name string table.
If the file has no section name string
table, this member holds the value

If the index of section name string table section is larger than or equal to
<B>SHN_LORESERVE</B>

(0xff00), this member holds
<B>SHN_XINDEX</B>

(0xffff) and the real index of the section name string table section
is held in the
<I>sh_link</I>

member of the initial entry in section header table.
Otherwise, the
<I>sh_link</I>

member of the initial entry in section header table contains the value zero.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>SHN_UNDEF</B>

<DD>
This value marks an undefined, missing, irrelevant, or otherwise meaningless
section reference.
For example, a symbol
&quot;defined&quot;
relative to section number
<B>SHN_UNDEF</B>

is an undefined symbol.
<DT><B>SHN_LORESERVE</B>

<DD>
This value specifies the lower bound of the range of reserved indices.
<DT><B>SHN_LOPROC</B>

<DD>
Values greater than or equal to
<B>SHN_HIPROC</B>

are reserved for processor-specific semantics.
<DT><B>SHN_HIPROC</B>

<DD>
Values less than or equal to
<B>SHN_LOPROC</B>

are reserved for processor-specific semantics.
<DT><B>SHN_ABS</B>

<DD>
This value specifies absolute values for the corresponding reference.
For
example, symbols defined relative to section number
<B>SHN_ABS</B>

have absolute values and are not affected by relocation.
<DT><B>SHN_COMMON</B>

<DD>
Symbols defined relative to this section are common symbols, such as Fortran
COMMON or unallocated C external variables.
<DT><B>SHN_HIRESERVE</B>

<DD>
This value specifies the upper bound of the range of reserved
indices between
<B>SHN_LORESERVE</B>

and
<B>SHN_HIRESERVE</B>,

inclusive; the values do
not reference the section header table.
That is, the section header table
does
<I>not</I>

contain entries for the reserved indices.
</DL>
</DL>



</DL>
<P>

An executable or shared object file's program header table is an array of
structures, each describing a segment or other information the system needs
to prepare the program for execution.
An object file
<I>segment</I>

contains one or more
<I>sections</I>.

Program headers are meaningful only for executable and shared object files.
A file specifies its own program header size with the ELF header's
<I>e_phentsize</I>

and
<I>e_phnum</I>

members.
The ELF program header is described by the type
<I>Elf32_Phdr</I>

or
<I>Elf64_Phdr</I>

depending on the architecture:

<PRE>

typedef struct {
    uint32_t   p_type;
    Elf32_Off  p_offset;
    Elf32_Addr p_vaddr;
    Elf32_Addr p_paddr;
    uint32_t   p_filesz;
    uint32_t   p_memsz;
    uint32_t   p_flags;
    uint32_t   p_align;
} Elf32_Phdr;
</PRE>



<PRE>

typedef struct {
    uint32_t   p_type;
    uint32_t   p_flags;
    Elf64_Off  p_offset;
    Elf64_Addr p_vaddr;
    Elf64_Addr p_paddr;
    uint64_t   p_filesz;
    uint64_t   p_memsz;
    uint64_t   p_align;
} Elf64_Phdr;
</PRE>


<P>

The main difference between the 32-bit and the 64-bit program header lies
in the location of the
<I>p_flags</I>

member in the total struct.

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><I>p_type</I>

<DD>
This member of the Phdr struct tells what kind of segment this array
element describes or how to interpret the array element's information.

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>PT_NULL</B>

<DD>
The array element is unused and the other members' values are undefined.
This lets the program header have ignored entries.
<DT><B>PT_LOAD</B>

<DD>
The array element specifies a loadable segment, described by
<I>p_filesz</I>

and
<I>p_memsz</I>.

The bytes from the file are mapped to the beginning of the memory
segment.
If the segment's memory size
<I>p_memsz</I>

is larger than the file size
<I>p_filesz</I>,

the
&quot;extra&quot;
bytes are defined to hold the value 0 and to follow the segment's
initialized area.
The file size may not be larger than the memory size.
Loadable segment entries in the program header table appear in ascending
order, sorted on the
<I>p_vaddr</I>

member.
<DT><B>PT_DYNAMIC</B>

<DD>
The array element specifies dynamic linking information.
<DT><B>PT_INTERP</B>

<DD>
The array element specifies the location and size of a null-terminated
pathname to invoke as an interpreter.
This segment type is meaningful
only for executable files (though it may occur for shared objects).
However it may not occur more than once in a file.
If it is present, it must precede any loadable segment entry.
<DT><B>PT_NOTE</B>

<DD>
The array element specifies the location and size for auxiliary information.
<DT><B>PT_SHLIB</B>

<DD>
This segment type is reserved but has unspecified semantics.
Programs that
contain an array element of this type do not conform to the ABI.
<DT><B>PT_PHDR</B>

<DD>
The array element, if present, specifies the location and size of the program
header table itself, both in the file and in the memory image of the program.
This segment type may not occur more than once in a file.
Moreover, it may
occur only if the program header table is part of the memory image of the
program.
If it is present, it must precede any loadable segment entry.
<DT><B>PT_LOPROC</B>

<DD>
Values greater than or equal to
<B>PT_HIPROC</B>

are reserved for processor-specific semantics.
<DT><B>PT_HIPROC</B>

<DD>
Values less than or equal to
<B>PT_LOPROC</B>

are reserved for processor-specific semantics.
<DT><B>PT_GNU_STACK</B>

<DD>
GNU extension which is used by the Linux kernel to control the state of the
stack via the flags set in the
<I>p_flags</I>

member.

</DL>
</DL>

<DT><I>p_offset</I>

<DD>
This member holds the offset from the beginning of the file at which
the first byte of the segment resides.
<DT><I>p_vaddr</I>

<DD>
This member holds the virtual address at which the first byte of the
segment resides in memory.
<DT><I>p_paddr</I>

<DD>
On systems for which physical addressing is relevant, this member is
reserved for the segment's physical address.
Under
BSD
this member is
not used and must be zero.
<DT><I>p_filesz</I>

<DD>
This member holds the number of bytes in the file image of the segment.
It may be zero.
<DT><I>p_memsz</I>

<DD>
This member holds the number of bytes in the memory image of the segment.
It may be zero.
<DT><I>p_flags</I>

<DD>
This member holds a bit mask of flags relevant to the segment:

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>PF_X</B>

An executable segment.
<DT><B>PF_W</B>

<DD>
A writable segment.
<DT><B>PF_R</B>

<DD>
A readable segment.

</DL>
</DL>


<DT><DD>
A text segment commonly has the flags
<B>PF_X</B>

and
<B>PF_R</B>.

A data segment commonly has
<B>PF_X</B>,

<B>PF_W</B>

and
<B>PF_R</B>.

<DT><I>p_align</I>

<DD>
This member holds the value to which the segments are aligned in memory
and in the file.
Loadable process segments must have congruent values for
<I>p_vaddr</I>

and
<I>p_offset</I>,

modulo the page size.
Values of zero and one mean no alignment is required.
Otherwise,
<I>p_align</I>

should be a positive, integral power of two, and
<I>p_vaddr</I>

should equal
<I>p_offset</I>,

modulo
<I>p_align</I>.


</DL>
<P>

A file's section header table lets one locate all the file's sections.
The
section header table is an array of
<I>Elf32_Shdr</I>

or
<I>Elf64_Shdr</I>

structures.
The
ELF header's
<I>e_shoff</I>

member gives the byte offset from the beginning of the file to the section
header table.
<I>e_shnum</I>

holds the number of entries the section header table contains.
<I>e_shentsize</I>

holds the size in bytes of each entry.
<P>

A section header table index is a subscript into this array.
Some section
header table indices are reserved:
the initial entry and the indices between
<B>SHN_LORESERVE</B>

and
<B>SHN_HIRESERVE</B>.

The initial entry is used in ELF extensions for
<I>e_phnum</I>,

<I>e_shnum</I>

and
<I>e_strndx</I>;

in other cases, each field in the initial entry is set to zero.
An object file does not have sections for
these special indices:

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>SHN_UNDEF</B>

<DD>
This value marks an undefined, missing, irrelevant, or otherwise meaningless
section reference.
<DT><B>SHN_LORESERVE</B>

<DD>
This value specifies the lower bound of the range of reserved indices.
<DT><B>SHN_LOPROC</B>

<DD>
Values greater than or equal to
<B>SHN_HIPROC</B>

are reserved for processor-specific semantics.
<DT><B>SHN_HIPROC</B>

<DD>
Values less than or equal to
<B>SHN_LOPROC</B>

are reserved for processor-specific semantics.
<DT><B>SHN_ABS</B>

<DD>
This value specifies the absolute value for the corresponding reference.
For

</DL>
<P>

String table sections hold null-terminated character sequences, commonly
called strings.
The object file uses these strings to represent symbol
and section names.
One references a string as an index into the string
table section.
The first byte, which is index zero, is defined to hold
a null byte ('\0').
Similarly, a string table's last byte is defined to
hold a null byte, ensuring null termination for all strings.
<P>

An object file's symbol table holds information needed to locate and
relocate a program's symbolic definitions and references.
A symbol table
index is a subscript into this array.

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><I>st_name</I>

<DD>
This member holds an index into the object file's symbol string table,
which holds character representations of the symbol names.

By convention, the symbol's name gives the name of the source file
associated with the object file.
A file symbol has
<B>STB_LOCAL</B>

bindings, its section index is
<B>SHN_ABS</B>,

and it precedes the other
<B>STB_LOCAL</B>

symbols of the file, if it is present.

Every symbol table entry is
&quot;defined&quot;
in relation to some section.
This member holds the relevant section
header table index.

</DL>
<P>

Relocation is the process of connecting symbolic references with
symbolic definitions.
Relocatable files must have information that
describes how to modify their section contents, thus allowing executable
and shared object files to hold the right information for a process's
program image.
Relocation entries are these data.

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><I>r_offset</I>

<DD>
This member gives the location at which to apply the relocation action.
For a relocatable file, the value is the byte offset from the beginning
of the section to the storage unit affected by the relocation.
For an
executable file or shared object, the value is the virtual address of
the storage unit affected by the relocation.
<DT><I>r_info</I>

<DD>
This member gives both the symbol table index with respect to which the
relocation must be made and the type of relocation to apply.
Relocation
types are processor-specific.
When the text refers to a relocation
entry's relocation type or symbol table index, it means the result of
applying
<B>ELF[32|64]_R_TYPE</B>

or
<B>ELF[32|64]_R_SYM</B>,

respectively, to the entry's
<I>r_info</I>

<DT><I>d_val</I>

<DD>
This member represents integer values with various interpretations.
<DT><I>d_ptr</I>

<DD>
This member represents program virtual addresses.
When interpreting
these addresses, the actual address should be computed based on the
original file value and memory base address.
Files do not contain
relocation entries to fixup these addresses.
<DT><I>_DYNAMIC</I>

<DD>
Array containing all the dynamic structures in the .dynamic section.
This is automatically populated by the linker.
