<A NAME="lbAB">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NAME</H2>

filesystems - Linux filesystem types: minix, ext, ext2, ext3, Reiserfs,
XFS, JFS, xia, msdos,
umsdos, vfat, proc, nfs, iso9660, hpfs, sysv, smb, ncpfs
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

When, as is customary, the
<B>proc</B>

filesystem is mounted on
<I>/proc</I>,

you can find in the file
<I>/proc/filesystems</I>

which filesystems your kernel currently supports.
If you need a currently unsupported one, insert the corresponding
module or recompile the kernel.
<P>
In order to use a filesystem, you have to
<I>mount</I>

it; see
<B><A HREF="../man8/mount.8.html">mount</A></B>(8).

<P>
Below a short description of a few of the available filesystems.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>minix</B>

<DD>
is the filesystem used in the Minix operating system, the first to run
under Linux.
It has a number of shortcomings: a 64MB partition size
limit, short filenames, a single time stamp, etc.
It remains useful for floppies and RAM disks.
<DT><B>ext</B>

<DD>
is an elaborate extension of the
<B>minix</B>

filesystem.
It has been completely superseded by the second version
of the extended filesystem
(<B>ext2</B>)

and has been removed from the kernel (in 2.1.21).
<DT><B>ext2</B>

<DD>
is the high performance disk filesystem used by Linux for fixed disks
as well as removable media.
The second extended filesystem was designed as an extension of the
extended file system
(<B>ext</B>).

<B>ext2</B>

offers the best performance (in terms of speed and CPU usage) of
the filesystems supported under Linux.
<DT><B>ext3</B>

<DD>
is a journaling version of the ext2 filesystem.
It is easy to
switch back and forth between ext2 and ext3.
<DT><B>Reiserfs</B>

<DD>
is a journaling file system, designed by Hans Reiser,
that was integrated into Linux in kernel 2.4.1.
<DT><B>XFS</B>

<DD>
is a journaling file system, developed by SGI,
that was integrated into Linux in kernel 2.4.20.
<DT><B>JFS</B>

<DD>
is a journaling file system, developed by IBM,
that was integrated into Linux in kernel 2.4.24.
<DT><B>xiafs</B>

<DD>
was designed and implemented to be a stable, safe filesystem by
extending the Minix filesystem code.
It provides the basic most
requested features without undue complexity.
The
<B>xia</B>

filesystem is no longer actively developed or maintained.
It was removed from the kernel in 2.1.21.
<DT><B>msdos</B>

<DD>
is the filesystem used by DOS, Windows, and some OS/2 computers.
<B>msdos</B>

filenames can be no longer than 8 characters, followed by an
optional period and 3 character extension.
<DT><B>umsdos</B>

<DD>
is an extended DOS filesystem used by Linux.
It adds capability for
long filenames, UID/GID, POSIX permissions, and special files
(devices, named pipes, etc.)  under the DOS filesystem, without
sacrificing compatibility with DOS.
<DT><B>vfat</B>

<DD>
is an extended DOS filesystem used by Microsoft Windows95 and Windows NT.
VFAT adds the capability to use long filenames under the MSDOS filesystem.
<DT><B>proc</B>

<DD>
is a pseudo-filesystem which is used as an interface to kernel data
structures rather than reading and interpreting
<I>/dev/kmem</I>.

In particular, its files do not take disk space.
See
<B><A HREF="../man5/proc.5.html">proc</A></B>(5).

<DT><B>iso9660</B>

<DD>
is a CD-ROM filesystem type conforming to the ISO 9660 standard.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>High Sierra</B>

<DD>
Linux supports High Sierra, the precursor to the ISO 9660 standard for
CD-ROM filesystems.
It is automatically recognized within the
<B>iso9660</B>

filesystem support under Linux.
<DT><B>Rock Ridge</B>

<DD>
Linux also supports the System Use Sharing Protocol records specified
by the Rock Ridge Interchange Protocol.
They are used to further describe the files in the
<B>iso9660</B>

filesystem to a UNIX host, and provide information such as long
filenames, UID/GID, POSIX permissions, and devices.
It is automatically recognized within the
<B>iso9660</B>

filesystem support under Linux.
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><B>hpfs</B>

<DD>
is the High Performance Filesystem, used in OS/2.
This filesystem is
read-only under Linux due to the lack of available documentation.
<DT><B>sysv</B>

<DD>
is an implementation of the SystemV/Coherent filesystem for Linux.
It implements all of Xenix FS, SystemV/386 FS, and Coherent FS.
<DT><B>nfs</B>

<DD>
is the network filesystem used to access disks located on remote computers.
<DT><B>smb</B>

<DD>
is a network filesystem that supports the SMB protocol, used by
Windows for Workgroups, Windows NT, and Lan Manager.
<P>
To use
<B>smb</B>

fs, you need a special mount program, which can be found in the ksmbfs
package, found at
<I><A HREF="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/Filesystems/smbfs">ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/Filesystems/smbfs</A></I>.

<DT><B>ncpfs</B>

<DD>
is a network filesystem that supports the NCP protocol, used by
Novell NetWare.
<P>
To use
<B>ncpfs</B>,

you need special programs, which can be found at
<I><A HREF="ftp://linux01.gwdg.de/pub/ncpfs">ftp://linux01.gwdg.de/pub/ncpfs</A></I>.
