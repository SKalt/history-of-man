host.conf - resolver configuration file
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The file
<I>/etc/host.conf</I>

contains configuration information specific to the resolver library.
It should contain one configuration keyword per line, followed by
appropriate configuration information.
The keywords recognized are
<I>order</I>, <I>trim</I>, <I>multi</I>, <I>nospoof</I>, <I>spoof</I>, and <I>reorder</I>.

These keywords are described below.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><I>order</I>

<DD>
This keyword specifies how host lookups are to be performed.
It should be followed by one or more lookup methods, separated by commas.
Valid methods are
<I>bind</I>, <I>hosts</I>, and <I>nis</I>.

<DT><I>trim</I>

<DD>
This keyword may be listed more than once.
Each time it should be
followed by a list of domains, separated by colons (':'), semicolons
(';') or commas (','), with the leading dot.
When set, the
resolv+ library will automatically trim the given domain name from the
end of any hostname resolved via DNS.
This is intended for use with
local hosts and domains.
(Related note: trim will not affect hostnames
gathered via NIS or the hosts file.
Care should be taken to
ensure that the first hostname for each entry in the hosts file is
fully qualified or unqualified, as appropriate for the local
installation.)
<DT><I>multi</I>

<DD>
Valid values are
<I>on</I> and <I>off</I>.

If set to
<I>on</I>,

the resolv+ library will return all valid addresses for a host that
appears in the
<I>/etc/hosts</I>

file,
instead of only the first.
This is
<I>off</I>

by default, as it may cause a substantial performance loss at sites
with large hosts files.
<DT><I>nospoof</I>

<DD>
Valid values are
<I>on</I> and <I>off</I>.

If set to
<I>on</I>,

the resolv+ library will attempt to prevent hostname spoofing to
enhance the security of
<B>rlogin</B> and <B>rsh</B>.

It works as follows: after performing a host address lookup, resolv+
will perform a hostname lookup for that address.
If the two hostnames
do not match, the query will fail.
The default value is
<I>off</I>.

<DT><I>spoofalert</I>

<DD>
Valid values are
<I>on</I> and <I>off</I>.

If this option is set to
<I>on</I>

and the
<I>nospoof</I>

option is also set, resolv+ will log a warning of the error via the
syslog facility.
The default value is
<I>off</I>.

<DT><I>spoof</I>

<DD>
Valid values are
<I>off</I>, <I>nowarn</I> and <I>warn</I>.

If this option is set to
<I>off</I>,

spoofed addresses are permitted and no warnings will be emitted
via the syslog facility.
If this option is set to
<I>warn</I>,

resolv+ will attempt to prevent hostname spoofing to
enhance the security and log a warning of the error via the syslog
facility.
If this option is set to
<I>nowarn</I>,

the resolv+ library will attempt to prevent hostname spoofing to
enhance the security but not emit warnings via the syslog facility.
Setting this option to anything else is equal to setting it to
<I>nowarn</I>.

<DT><I>reorder</I>

<DD>
Valid values are
<I>on</I> and <I>off</I>.

If set to
<I>on</I>,

resolv+ will attempt to reorder host addresses so that local addresses
(i.e., on the same subnet) are listed first when a
<B><A HREF="../man3/gethostbyname.3.html">gethostbyname</A></B>(3)

is performed.
Reordering is done for all lookup methods.
The default value is
<I>off</I>.

</DL>
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ENVIRONMENT</H2>

There are six environment variables that can be used to allow users to
override the behavior which is configured in
<I>/etc/host.conf</I>.

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>RESOLV_HOST_CONF</B>

<DD>
If set this variable points to a file that should be read instead of
<I>/etc/host.conf</I>.

<DT><B>RESOLV_SERV_ORDER</B>

<DD>
Overrides the
<I>order</I>

command.
<DT><B>RESOLV_SPOOF_CHECK</B>

<DD>
Overrides the
<I>nospoof</I>, <I>spoofalert</I> and <I>spoof</I>

commands in the same way as the
<I>spoof</I>

command is parsed.
Valid values are
<I>off</I>, <I>nowarn</I> and <I>warn</I>.

<DT><B>RESOLV_MULTI</B>

<DD>
Overrides the
<I>multi</I>

command.
<DT><B>RESOLV_REORDER</B>

<DD>
Overrides the
<I>reorder</I>

command.
<DT><B>RESOLV_ADD_TRIM_DOMAINS</B>

<DD>
A list of domains,  separated by colons (':'), semicolons (';') or
commas (','), with the leading dot, which will be added to the list of
domains that should be trimmed.
<DT><B>RESOLV_OVERRIDE_TRIM_DOMAINS</B>

<DD>
A list of domains,  separated by colons (':'), semicolons (';') or
commas (','), with the leading dot, which will replace the list of
domains that should be trimmed.
Overrides the
<I>trim</I>

command.

<H2>FILES</H2>

<DL COMPACT>

<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NOTES</H2>

The following differences exist compared to the original implementation.
A new command
<I>spoof</I>

and a new environment variable
<B>RESOLV_SPOOF_CHECK</B>

can take arguments like
<I>off</I>, <I>nowarn</I> and <I>warn</I>.

Line comments can appear anywhere and not only at the beginning of a line.
