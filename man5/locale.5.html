<A NAME="lbAB">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NAME</H2>

locale - describes a locale definition file
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The
<B>locale</B>

definition file contains all the information that the
<B><A HREF="../man1/localedef.1.html">localedef</A></B>(1)

command needs to convert it into the binary locale database.
<P>

The definition files consist of sections which each describe a
locale category in detail.
See
<B><A HREF="../man7/locale.7.html">locale</A></B>(7)

for additional details for these categories.
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Syntax</H3>

The locale definition file starts with a header that may consist
of the following keywords:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><I>escape_char</I>

<DD>
is followed by a character that should be used as the
escape-character for the rest of the file to mark characters that
should be interpreted in a special way.
It defaults to the backslash (\).
<DT><I>comment_char</I>

<DD>
is followed by a character that will be used as the
comment-character for the rest of the file.
It defaults to the number sign (#).
</DL>
<P>

The locale definition has one part for each locale category.
Each part can be copied from another existing locale or
can be defined from scratch.
If the category should be copied,
the only valid keyword in the definition is
<I>copy</I>

followed by the name of the locale in double quotes which should be
copied.
The exceptions for this rule are
<B>LC_COLLATE</B>

and
<B>LC_CTYPE</B>

where a
<I>copy</I>

statement can be followed by locale-specific rules and selected overrides.
<P>

When defining a locale or a category from scratch, an existing system-
provided locale definition file should be used as a reference to follow
common glibc conventions.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Locale category sections</H3>

The following category sections are defined by POSIX:

<B>LC_MONETARY</B>

<DT>*<DD>
<B>LC_NUMERIC</B>

<DT>*<DD>
<B>LC_TIME</B>

The collective GNU C library community wisdom regarding
<I>abday</I>,

<I>day</I>,

<I>week</I>,

<I>first_weekday</I>,

and
<I>first_workday</I>

states at
<A HREF="https://sourceware.org/glibc/wiki/Locales">https://sourceware.org/glibc/wiki/Locales</A>
the following:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
The value of the second
<I>week</I>

list item specifies the base of the
<I>abday</I>

and
<I>day</I>

lists.
<DT>*<DD>
<I>first_weekday</I>

specifies the offset of the first day-of-week in the
<I>abday</I>

and
<I>day</I>

lists.
<DT>*<DD>
For compatibility reasons, all glibc locales should set the value of the
second
<I>week</I>

list item to
<B>19971130</B>

(Sunday) and base the
<I>abday</I>

and
<I>day</I>

lists appropriately, and set
<I>first_weekday</I>

and
<I>first_workday</I>

to
<B>1</B>

or
<B>2</B>,

depending on whether the week and work week actually starts on Sunday or
Monday for the locale.
