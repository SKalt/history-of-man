motd - message of the day

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The contents of
<I>/etc/motd</I>

are displayed by
<B><A HREF="../man1/login.1.html">login</A></B>(1)

after a successful login but just before it executes the login shell.
<P>
The abbreviation &quot;motd&quot; stands for &quot;message of the day&quot;, and this file
has been traditionally used for exactly that (it requires much less disk
space than mail to all users).
