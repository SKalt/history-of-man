passwd - password file
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The
<I>/etc/passwd</I>

file is a text file that describes user login accounts for the system.
It should have read permission allowed for all users (many utilities, like
<B><A HREF="../man1/ls.1.html">ls</A></B>(1)

use it to map user IDs to usernames), but write access only for the
superuser.
<P>

In the good old days there was no great problem with this general
read permission.
Everybody could read the encrypted passwords, but the
hardware was too slow to crack a well-chosen password, and moreover the
basic assumption used to be that of a friendly user-community.
These days many people run some version of the shadow password suite, where
<I>/etc/passwd</I>

has an 'x' character in the password field,
and the encrypted passwords are in
<I>/etc/shadow</I>,

which is readable by the superuser only.
<P>

If the encrypted password, whether in
<I>/etc/passwd</I>

or in
<I>/etc/shadow</I>,

is an empty string, login is allowed without even asking for a password.
Note that this functionality may be intentionally disabled in applications,
or configurable (for example using the &quot;nullok&quot; or &quot;nonull&quot; arguments to
pam_unix.so).
<P>

If the encrypted password in
<I>/etc/passwd</I>

is &quot;<I>*NP*</I>&quot; (without the quotes),
the shadow record should be obtained from an NIS+ server.
<P>

Regardless of whether shadow passwords are used, many system administrators
use an asterisk (*) in the encrypted password field to make sure
that this user can not authenticate him- or herself using a
password.
(But see NOTES below.)
<P>

If you create a new login, first put an asterisk (*) in the password field,
then use
<B><A HREF="../man1/passwd.1.html">passwd</A></B>(1)

to set it.
<P>

Each line of the file describes a single user,
and contains seven colon-separated fields:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
name:password:UID:GID:GECOS:directory:shell
</DL>

<P>
The field are as follows:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><I>name</I>

<DD>
This is the user's login name.
It should not contain capital letters.
<DT><I>password</I>

<DD>
This is either the encrypted user password,
an asterisk (*), or the letter 'x'.
(See
<B><A HREF="../man8/pwconv.8.html">pwconv</A></B>(8)

for an explanation of 'x'.)
<DT><I>UID</I>

<DD>
The privileged
<I>root</I>

login account (superuser) has the user ID 0.
<DT><I>GID</I>

<DD>
This is the numeric primary group ID for this user.
(Additional groups for the user are defined in the system group file; see
<B><A HREF="../man5/group.5.html">group</A></B>(5)).

<DT><I>GECOS</I>

<DD>
This field (sometimes called the &quot;comment field&quot;)
is optional and used only for informational purposes.
Usually, it contains the full username.
Some programs (for example,
<B><A HREF="../man1/finger.1.html">finger</A></B>(1))

display information from this field.
<DT><DD>
GECOS stands for &quot;General Electric Comprehensive Operating System&quot;,
which was renamed to GCOS when
GE's large systems division was sold to Honeywell.
Dennis Ritchie has reported: &quot;Sometimes we sent printer output or
batch jobs to the GCOS machine.
The gcos field in the password file was a place to stash the
information for the $IDENTcard.
Not elegant.&quot;
<DT><I>directory</I>

<DD>
This is the user's home directory:
the initial directory where the user is placed after logging in.
The value in this field is used to set the
<B>HOME</B>

environment variable.
<DT><I>shell</I>

<DD>
This is the program to run at login (if empty, use
<I>/bin/sh</I>).

If set to a nonexistent executable, the user will be unable to login
through
<B><A HREF="../man1/login.1.html">login</A></B>(1).

The value in this field is used to set the
<B>SHELL</B>

environment variable.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>FILES</H2>

<I>/etc/passwd</I>

<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NOTES</H2>

If you want to create user groups, there must be an entry in
<I>/etc/group</I>,

or no group will exist.
<P>

If the encrypted password is set to an asterisk (*), the user will be unable
to login using
<B><A HREF="../man1/login.1.html">login</A></B>(1),

but may still login using
<B><A HREF="../man1/rlogin.1.html">rlogin</A></B>(1),

run existing processes and initiate new ones through
<B><A HREF="../man1/rsh.1.html">rsh</A></B>(1),

<B><A HREF="../man8/cron.8.html">cron</A></B>(8),

<B><A HREF="../man1/at.1.html">at</A></B>(1),

or mail filters, etc.
Trying to lock an account by simply changing the
shell field yields the same result and additionally allows the use of
<B><A HREF="../man1/su.1.html">su</A></B>(1).
