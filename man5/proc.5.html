<H2>NAME</H2>

proc - process information pseudo-filesystem
<P>
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The
<I>proc</I>

filesystem is a pseudo-filesystem which is used as an interface to
kernel data structures. It is commonly mounted at
<I>/proc</I>.

Most of it is read-only, but some files allow kernel variables to be 
changed.
<P>

The following outline gives a quick tour through the /proc hierarchy.

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><I>/proc/[number]</I>

<DD>
There is a numerical subdirectory for each running process; the
subdirectory is named by the process ID.
Each such subdirectory contains the following
pseudo-files and directories.
<DT><I>/proc/[number]/cmdline</I>

<DD>
This holds the complete command line for the process, unless the whole
process has been swapped out or the process is a zombie.  In
either of these latter cases, there is nothing in this file: i.e. a
read on this file will return 0 characters.
The command line arguments appear in this file as a set of 
null-separated strings, with a further null byte after the last string.
<DT><I>/proc/[number]/cwd</I>

<DD>
This is a symbolic link to the current working directory of the process.  
To find out the cwd of process 20, for instance, you can do this:
<P>
<BR>

<PRE>
cd /proc/20/cwd; /bin/pwd
</PRE>


<P>
Note that the 
<I>pwd </I>

command is often a shell builtin, and might
not work properly. In bash, you may use pwd -P.
<P>

In a multithreaded process, the contents of this symbolic link 
are not available if the main thread has already terminated 
(typically by calling
<B><A HREF="../man3/pthread_exit.3.html">pthread_exit</A></B>(3).

<DT><I>/proc/[number]/environ</I>

<DD>
This file contains the environment for the process.
The entries are separated by null bytes ('\0'),
and there may be a null bytes at the end.
Thus, to print out the environment of process 1, you would do:
<P>
<BR>

<PRE>
(cat /proc/1/environ; echo) | tr &quot;\000&quot; &quot;\n&quot;
</PRE>


<P>
(For a reason why one should want to do this, see
<B><A HREF="../man8/lilo.8.html">lilo</A></B>(8).)

<DT><I>/proc/[number]/exe</I>

<DD>
Under Linux 2.2 and later, this file is a symbolic link
containing the actual pathname of the executed command.
This symbolic link can be dereferenced normally; attempting to open 
it will open the executable.  You can even type
<I>/proc/[number]/exe</I>

to run another copy of the same executable as is being run by 
process [number].

In a multithreaded process, the contents of this symbolic link 
are not available if the main thread has already terminated 
(typically by calling
<B><A HREF="../man3/pthread_exit.3.html">pthread_exit</A></B>(3)).

<P>
Under Linux 2.0 and earlier
<I>/proc/[number]/exe</I>

is a pointer to the binary which was executed, 
and appears as a symbolic link. A
<B><A HREF="../man2/readlink.2.html">readlink</A></B>(2)

call on this file under Linux 2.0 returns a string in the format:
<P>
[device]:inode
<P>
For example, [0301]:1502 would be inode 1502 on device major 03 (IDE,
MFM, etc. drives) minor 01 (first partition on the first drive).
<P>
<B><A HREF="../man1/find.1.html">find</A></B>(1)

with the -inum option can be used to locate the file.
<DT><I>/proc/[number]/fd</I>

<DD>
This is a subdirectory containing one entry for each file which the
process has open, named by its file descriptor, and which is a
symbolic link to the actual file.  Thus, 0 is
standard input, 1 standard output, 2 standard error, etc.
<P>

In a multithreaded process, the contents of this directory
are not available if the main thread has already terminated 
(typically by calling
<B><A HREF="../man3/pthread_exit.3.html">pthread_exit</A></B>(3)).

<P>
Programs that will take a filename, but will not take the standard
input, and which write to a file, but will not send their output to
standard output, can be effectively foiled this way, assuming that -i
is the flag designating an input file and -o is the flag designating
an output file:
<BR>

<PRE>

<TT>foobar -i /proc/self/fd/0 -o /proc/self/fd/1 ...</TT>

</PRE>

<BR>

and you have a working filter.




<P>
/proc/self/fd/N is approximately the same as /dev/fd/N in some UNIX
and UNIX-like systems.  Most Linux MAKEDEV scripts symbolically link
/dev/fd to /proc/self/fd, in fact.


<DT><I>/proc/[number]/maps</I>

<DD>
A file containing the currently mapped memory regions and their access
permissions.
<P>
The format is:
<P>
<PRE>
address           perms offset  dev   inode      pathname
08048000-08056000 r-xp 00000000 03:0c 64593      /usr/sbin/gpm
08056000-08058000 rw-p 0000d000 03:0c 64593      /usr/sbin/gpm
08058000-0805b000 rwxp 00000000 00:00 0
40000000-40013000 r-xp 00000000 03:0c 4165       /lib/ld-2.2.4.so
40013000-40015000 rw-p 00012000 03:0c 4165       /lib/ld-2.2.4.so
4001f000-40135000 r-xp 00000000 03:0c 45494      /lib/libc-2.2.4.so
40135000-4013e000 rw-p 00115000 03:0c 45494      /lib/libc-2.2.4.so
4013e000-40142000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0
bffff000-c0000000 rwxp 00000000 00:00 0
</PRE>


<P>
where address is the address space in the process that it occupies,
perms is a set of permissions:
<P>
<PRE>
r = read
w = write
x = execute
s = shared
p = private (copy on write)
</PRE>


<P>
offset is the offset into the file/whatever, dev is the device
(major:minor), and inode is the inode on that device.  0 indicates
that no inode is associated with the memory region, as the case would
be with bss.
<P>
Under Linux 2.0 there is no field giving pathname.
<DT><I>/proc/[number]/mem</I>

<DD>
This file can be used to access the pages of a process's memory through
<B><A HREF="../man2/open.2.html">open</A></B>(2),

<B><A HREF="../man2/read.2.html">read</A></B>(2),

and
<B><A HREF="../man3/fseek.3.html">fseek</A></B>(3).






<DT><I>/proc/[number]/root</I>

<DD>
Unix and Linux support the idea of a per-process root of the
filesystem, set by the
<B><A HREF="../man2/chroot.2.html">chroot</A></B>(2)

system call.  This file is a symbolic link that points to the process's
root directory, and behaves as exe, fd/*, etc. do.
<P>

In a multithreaded process, the contents of this symbolic link 
are not available if the main thread has already terminated 
(typically by calling
<B><A HREF="../man3/pthread_exit.3.html">pthread_exit</A></B>(3)).



<DT><I>/proc/[number]/stat</I>

<DD>
Status information about the process.  This is used by
<B><A HREF="../man1/ps.1.html">ps</A></B>(1).

It is defined in 
<I>/usr/src/linux/fs/proc/array.c</I>.

<P>

</DL>
</DL>

<DT><I>/proc/[number]/statm</I>

<DD>
Provides information about memory status in pages.  The columns are:
<BR>&nbsp;size&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;total&nbsp;program&nbsp;size
<BR>&nbsp;resident&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;resident&nbsp;set&nbsp;size
<BR>&nbsp;share&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shared&nbsp;pages
<BR>&nbsp;text&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;text&nbsp;(code)

<BR>&nbsp;data&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;data/stack
<BR>&nbsp;dt&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dirty&nbsp;pages&nbsp;(unused&nbsp;in&nbsp;Linux&nbsp;2.6)
<DT><I>/proc/[number]/status</I>

<DD>
Provides much of the information in
<I>/proc/[number]/stat</I>

and
<I>/proc/[number]/statm</I>

in a format that's easier for humans to parse.
<DT><I>/proc/[number]/task</I> (since kernel 2.6.0-test6)

<DD>
This is a directory that contains one subdirectory
for each thread in the process.
The name of each subdirectory is the numerical thread ID of the
thread (see
<B><A HREF="../man2/gettid.2.html">gettid</A></B>(2)).

Within each of these subdirectories, there is a set of
files with the same names and contents as under the
<I>/proc/[number]</I>

directories.
For attributes that are shared by all threads, the contents for
each of the files under the
<I>task/[thread-ID]</I>

subdirectories will be the same as in the corresponding
file in the parent 
<I>/proc/[number]</I>

directory
(e.g., in a multithreaded process, all of the 
<I>task/[thread-ID]/cwd</I>

files will have the same value as the 
<I>/proc/[number]/cwd</I>

file in the parent directory, since all of the threads in a process 
share a working directory).
For attributes that are distinct for each thread,
the corresponding files under 
<I>task/[thread-ID]</I>

may have different values (e.g., various fields in each of the
<I>task/[thread-ID]/status</I>

files may be different for each thread).
<P>

In a multithreaded process, the contents of the
<I>/proc/[number]/task</I>

directory are not available if the main thread has already terminated 
(typically by calling
<B><A HREF="../man3/pthread_exit.3.html">pthread_exit</A></B>(3)).

<DT><I>/proc/apm</I>

<DD>
Advanced power management version and battery information
when CONFIG_APM is defined at kernel compilation time.
<DT><I>/proc/bus</I>

<DD>
Contains subdirectories for installed busses.
<DT><I>/proc/bus/pccard</I>

<DD>
Subdirectory for pcmcia devices when CONFIG_PCMCIA is set
at kernel compilation time.
<DT><I>/proc/bus/pccard/drivers</I>

<DD>
<DT><I>/proc/bus/pci</I>

<DD>
Contains various bus subdirectories and pseudo-files containing 
information about pci busses, installed devices, and device 
drivers.  Some of these files are not ASCII.  
<DT><I>/proc/bus/pci/devices</I>

<DD>
Information about pci devices.  They may be accessed through 
<B><A HREF="../man8/lspci.8.html">lspci</A></B>(8)

and
<B><A HREF="../man8/setpci.8.html">setpci</A></B>(8).

<DT><I>/proc/cmdline</I>

<DD>
Arguments passed to the Linux kernel at boot time.  Often done via
a boot manager such as
<B><A HREF="../man1/lilo.1.html">lilo</A></B>(1).

<DT><I>/proc/cpuinfo</I>

<DD>
This is a collection of CPU and system architecture dependent items,
for each supported architecture a different list.
Two common entries are <I>processor</I> which gives CPU number and
<I>bogomips</I>; a system constant that is calculated 
during kernel initialization.  SMP machines have information for
each CPU.
<DT><I>/proc/devices</I>

<DD>
Text listing of major numbers and device groups.  This can be used by
MAKEDEV scripts for consistency with the kernel.
<DT><I>/proc/diskstats</I> (since Linux 2.5.69)

<DD>
This file contains disk I/O statistics for each disk device.
See the kernel source file
<I>Documentation/iostats.txt</I>

for further information.
<DT><I>/proc/dma</I>

<DD>
This is a list of the registered <I>ISA</I> DMA (direct memory access) 
channels in use.
<DT><I>/proc/driver</I>

<DD>
Empty subdirectory.
<DT><I>/proc/execdomains</I>

<DD>
List of the execution domains (ABI personalities).
<DT><I>/proc/fb</I>

<DD>
Frame buffer information when CONFIG_FB is defined during kernel 
compilation.
<DT><I>/proc/filesystems</I>

<DD>
A text listing of the filesystems which were compiled into the kernel.
Incidentally, this is used by
<B><A HREF="../man1/mount.1.html">mount</A></B>(1)

to cycle through different filesystems when none is specified.
<DT><I>/proc/fs</I>

<DD>
Empty subdirectory.
<DT><I>/proc/ide</I>

<DD>
This directory
exists on systems with the ide bus.  There are directories for each
ide channel and attached device.  Files include:
<P>
<PRE>
cache              buffer size in KB
capacity           number of sectors
driver             driver version
geometry           physical and logical geometry
identify           in hexadecimal
media              media type
model              manufacturer's model number
settings           drive settings
smart_thresholds   in hexadecimal
smart_values       in hexadecimal
</PRE>

<P>
The 
<B><A HREF="../man8/hdparm.8.html">hdparm</A></B>(8)

utility provides access to this information in a friendly format.
<DT><I>/proc/interrupts</I>

<DD>
This is used to record the number of interrupts per each IRQ on (at
least) the i386 architecture.  Very easy to read formatting, done in
ASCII.
<DT><I>/proc/iomem</I>

<DD>
I/O memory map in Linux 2.4.
<DT><I>/proc/ioports</I>

<DD>
This is a list of currently registered Input-Output port regions that 
are in use.
<DT><I>/proc/kallsyms</I> (since Linux 2.5.71)

<DD>
This holds the kernel exported symbol definitions used by the
<B>modules</B>(X)

tools to dynamically link and bind loadable modules.
In Linux 2.5.47 and earlier, a similar file with slightly different syntax
was named
<I>ksyms</I>.

<DT><I>/proc/kcore</I>

<DD>
This file represents the physical memory of the system and is stored
in the ELF core file format.  With this pseudo-file, and an unstripped
kernel (/usr/src/linux/vmlinux) binary, GDB can be used to
examine the current state of any kernel data structures.
<P>
The total length of the file is the size of physical memory (RAM) plus
4KB.
<DT><I>/proc/kmsg</I>

<DD>
This file can be used instead of the
<B><A HREF="../man2/syslog.2.html">syslog</A></B>(2)

system call to read kernel messages.  A process must have superuser
privileges to read this file, and only one process should read this
file.  This file should not be read if a syslog process is running
which uses the
<B><A HREF="../man2/syslog.2.html">syslog</A></B>(2)

system call facility to log kernel messages.
<P>
Information in this file is retrieved with the
<B><A HREF="../man8/dmesg.8.html">dmesg</A></B>(8)

program.
<DT><I>/proc/ksyms</I> (Linux 1.1.23-2.5.47)

<DD>
See
<I>/proc/kallsyms</I>.

<DT><I>/proc/loadavg</I>

<DD>
The first three fields in this file are load average figures
giving the number of jobs in the run queue (state R)
or waiting for disk I/O (state D) averaged over 1, 5, and 15 minutes.
They are the same as the load average numbers given by
<B><A HREF="../man1/uptime.1.html">uptime</A></B>(1)

and other programs.
The fourth field consists of two numbers separated by a slash (/).
The first of these is the number of currently executing kernel
scheduling entities (processes, threads); 
this will be less than or equal to the number of CPUs.
The value after the slash is the number of kernel scheduling entities
that currently exist on the system.
The fifth field is the PID of the process that was most
recently created on the system.
<DT><I>/proc/locks</I>

<DD>
This file shows current file locks
(<B><A HREF="../man2/flock.2.html">flock</A></B>(2) and <B><A HREF="../man2/fcntl.2.html">fcntl</A></B>(2))

and leases
(<B><A HREF="../man2/fcntl.2.html">fcntl</A></B>(2)).

<DT><I>/proc/malloc</I>

<DD>
This file is only present if CONFIGDEBUGMALLOC was defined during
compilation.
<DT><I>/proc/meminfo</I>

<DD>
This is used by
<B><A HREF="../man1/free.1.html">free</A></B>(1)

to report the amount of free and used memory (both physical and swap)
on the system as well as the shared memory and buffers used by the
kernel.
<P>
It is in the same format as
<B><A HREF="../man1/free.1.html">free</A></B>(1),

except in bytes rather than KB.
<DT><I>/proc/mounts</I>

<DD>
This is a list of all the file systems currently mounted on the system.
The format of this file is documented in
<B><A HREF="../man5/fstab.5.html">fstab</A></B>(5).

Since kernel version 2.6.15, this file is pollable: 
after opening the file for reading, a change in this file
(i.e., a file system mount or unmount) causes
<B><A HREF="../man2/select.2.html">select</A></B>(2)

to mark the file descriptor as readable, and
<B><A HREF="../man2/poll.2.html">poll</A></B>(2)

and
<B><A HREF="../man2/epoll_wait.2.html">epoll_wait</A></B>(2)

mark the file as having an error condition.
<DT><I>/proc/modules</I>

<DD>
A text list of the modules that have been loaded by the system.
See also
<B><A HREF="../man8/lsmod.8.html">lsmod</A></B>(8).

<DT><I>/proc/mtrr</I>

<DD>
Memory Type Range Registers.  
See 
<I>/usr/src/linux/Documentation/mtrr.txt</I>

for details.
<DT><I>/proc/net</I>

<DD>
various net pseudo-files, all of which give the status of some part of
the networking layer.  These files contain ASCII structures and are,
therefore, readable with cat.  However, the standard
<B><A HREF="../man8/netstat.8.html">netstat</A></B>(8)

suite provides much cleaner access to these files.
<DT><I>/proc/net/arp</I>

<DD>
This holds an ASCII readable dump of the kernel ARP table used for
address resolutions. It will show both dynamically learned and
pre-programmed ARP entries.  The format is:
<P>
<PRE>
IP address     HW type   Flags     HW address          Mask   Device
192.168.0.50   0x1       0x2       00:50:BF:25:68:F3   *      eth0
192.168.0.250  0x1       0xc       00:00:00:00:00:00   *      eth0
</PRE>


<P>
Here 'IP address' is the IPv4 address of the machine and the 'HW type'
is the hardware type of the address from RFC&nbsp;826. 
The flags are the internal 
flags of the ARP structure (as defined in /usr/include/linux/if_arp.h) and
the 'HW address' is the data link layer mapping for that IP address if
it is known.

<P>
Here 'Num' is the kernel table slot number, 'RefCount' is the number
of users of the socket, 'Protocol' is currently always 0, 'Flags'
represent the internal kernel flags holding the status of the
socket. Currently, type is always '1' (Unix domain datagram sockets are
not yet supported in the kernel). 'St' is the internal state of the
socket and Path is the bound path (if any) of the socket.
<DT><I>/proc/partitions</I>

<DD>
Contains major and minor numbers of each partition as well as number
of blocks and partition name.
<DT><I>/proc/pci</I>

<DD>
This is a listing of all PCI devices found during kernel initialization
and their configuration.
<DT><I>/proc/scsi</I>

<DD>
A directory with the scsi mid-level pseudo-file and various SCSI lowlevel 
driver 
directories, which contain a file for each SCSI host in this system, all 
of 
which give the status of some part of the SCSI IO subsystem.  
These files contain ASCII structures and are, therefore, readable with 
cat.  
<P>
You can also write to some of the files to reconfigure the subsystem or 
switch
certain features on or off.
<DT><I>/proc/scsi/scsi</I>

<DD>
This is a listing of all SCSI devices known to the kernel. The listing is 
similar to the one seen during bootup.
scsi currently supports only the <I>add-single-device</I> command which 
allows
root to add a hotplugged device to the list of known devices.
<P>
An 
<B>echo 'scsi add-single-device 1 0 5 0' &gt; /proc/scsi/scsi </B>

will cause 
host scsi1 to scan on SCSI channel 0 for a device on ID 5 LUN 0. If there 
is already a device known on this address or the address is invalid, an
error will be returned.
<DT><I>/proc/scsi/[drivername]</I>

scsi_debug, seagate, t128, u15-24f, ultrastore, or wd7000. 
These directories show up for all drivers that registered at least one 
SCSI 
HBA. Every directory contains one file per registered host. Every
host-file is named after the number the host was assigned during
initialization. 
<P>
Reading these files will usually show driver and host configuration, 
statistics etc.
<P>
Writing to these files allows different things on different hosts.
For example, with the <I>latency</I> and <I>nolatency</I> commands,
root can switch on and off command latency measurement code in the
eata_dma driver. With the <I>lockup</I> and <I>unlock</I> commands,
root can control bus lockups simulated by the scsi_debug driver.

want_pages
(pages requested by system) and two dummy values.
nr_dentry seems to be 0 all the time.
nr_unused seems to be the number of unused dentries.
age_limit is the age in seconds after which dcache entries
can be reclaimed when memory is short and want_pages is
non-zero when the kernel has called shrink_dcache_pages() and the
dcache isn't pruned yet.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/fs/dir-notify-enable</I>

This file can be used to disable or enable the
<I>dnotify</I>

interface described in

on a system-wide basis.
A value of 0 in this file disables the interface,
and a value of 1 enables it.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/fs/dquot-max</I>

<DD>
This file shows the maximum number of cached disk quota entries.
On some (2.4) systems, it is not present.
If the number of free cached disk quota entries is very low and
you have some awesome number of simultaneous system users,
you might want to raise the limit.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/fs/dquot-nr</I>

<DD>
This file shows the number of allocated disk quota
entries and the number of free disk quota entries.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/fs/file-max</I>

<DD>
This file defines
a system-wide limit on the number of open files for all processes.
(See also
<B><A HREF="../man2/setrlimit.2.html">setrlimit</A></B>(2),

which can be used by a process to set the per-process limit,
<B>RLIMIT_NOFILE</B>,

on the number of files it may open.)
If you get lots

try increasing this value:
<BR>

<P>
<BR>

<PRE>
echo 100000 &gt; /proc/sys/fs/file-max
</PRE>


<P>
The kernel constant
<I>NR_OPEN</I>

imposes an upper limit on the value that may be placed in
<I>file-max</I>.

<P>
If you increase 
<I>/proc/sys/fs/file-max</I>,

be sure to increase
<I>/proc/sys/fs/inode-max</I>

to 3-4 times the new
value of 
<I>/proc/sys/fs/file-max</I>,

or you will run out of inodes.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/fs/file-nr</I>

<DD>
This (read-only) file
gives the number of files presently opened.
It contains three numbers: The number of allocated
file handles, the number of free file handles and the maximum
number of file handles.  The kernel allocates file handles dynamically, 
but it
doesn't free them again.  If the number of allocated files is close to the 
<P>
maximum, you should consider increasing the maximum.
When the number of free file handles is
large, you've encountered a peak in your usage of file
handles and you probably don't need to increase the maximum.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/fs/inode-max </I>

<DD>
This file contains the maximum number of in-memory inodes.
On some (2.4) systems, it may not be
present. This value should be 3-4 times larger
than the value in file-max, since stdin, stdout and network sockets also
need an inode to handle them. When you regularly run
out of inodes, you need to increase this value.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/fs/inode-nr</I>

<DD>
This file contains the first two values from inode-state.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/fs/inode-state</I>

<DD>
This file
contains seven numbers: nr_inodes, nr_free_inodes, preshrink and four 
dummy
values.
nr_inodes is the number of inodes the system has
allocated.  This can be slightly more than inode-max because
Linux allocates them one page full at a time.
nr_free_inodes represents the number of free inodes.
preshrink is non-zero when the nr_inodes &gt; inode-max and the
system needs to prune the inode list instead of allocating
more.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/fs/inotify</I> (since Linux 2.6.13)

<DD>
This directory contains files 
<I>max_queued_events</I>, <I>max_user_instances</I>, and <I>max_user_watches</I>,

that can be used to limit the amount of kernel memory consumed by the
<I>inotify</I>

interface.
For further details, see 
<B><A HREF="../man7/inotify.7.html">inotify</A></B>(7).

<DT><I>/proc/sys/fs/lease-break-time</I>

<DD>
This file
specifies the grace period that the kernel grants to a process
holding a file lease
(<B><A HREF="../man2/fcntl.2.html">fcntl</A></B>(2))

after it has sent a signal to that process notifying it
that another process is waiting to open the file.
If the lease holder does not remove or downgrade the lease within
this grace period, the kernel forcibly breaks the lease.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/fs/leases-enable</I>

<DD>
This file can be used to enable or disable file leases
(<B><A HREF="../man2/fcntl.2.html">fcntl</A></B>(2))

on a system-wide basis.
If this file contains the value 0, leases are disabled.
A non-zero value enables leases.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/fs/mqueue</I> (since Linux 2.6.6)

<DD>
This directory contains files 
<I>msg_max</I>, <I>msgsize_max</I>, and <I>queues_max</I>,

controlling the resources used by POSIX message queues.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/fs/mqueue/msg_max</I>

<DD>
This file can be used to view and change the ceiling value for the 
maximum number of messages in a queue.
This value acts as a ceiling on the
<I>attr.mq_maxmsg</I>

argument given to
<B><A HREF="../man3/mq_open.3.html">mq_open</A></B>(3).

The default and minimum value for
<I>msg_max</I>

is 10; the upper limit is HARD_MAX:
<I>(131072&nbsp;/&nbsp;sizeof(void&nbsp;*))</I>

(32768 on Linux/86).
This limit is ignored for privileged processes
(<B>CAP_SYS_RESOURCE</B>),

but the HARD_MAX ceiling is nevertheless imposed.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/fs/mqueue/msgsize_max</I>

<DD>
This file can be used to view and change the ceiling on the 
maximum message size.
This value acts as a ceiling on the
<I>attr.mq_msgsize</I>

argument given to
<B><A HREF="../man3/mq_open.3.html">mq_open</A></B>(3).

The default and minimum value for
<I>msgsize_max</I>

is 8192 bytes; the upper limit is INT_MAX
(2147483647 on Linux/86).
This limit is ignored for privileged processes
(<B>CAP_SYS_RESOURCE</B>).

<DT><I>/proc/sys/fs/mqueue/queues_max</I>

<DD>
This file can be used to view and change the system-wide limit on the 
number of message queues that can be created.
Only privileged processes 
(<B>CAP_SYS_RESOURCE</B>)

can create new message queues once this limit has been reached.
The default value for
<I>queues_max</I>

is 256; it can be changed to any value in the range 0 to INT_MAX.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/fs/overflowgid</I> and <I>/proc/sys/fs/overflowuid</I>

<DD>
These files
allow you to change the value of the fixed UID and GID.
The default is 65534.
Some filesystems only support 16-bit UIDs and GIDs, although in Linux
UIDs and GIDs are 32 bits. When one of these filesystems is mounted
with writes enabled, any UID or GID that would exceed 65535 is translated
to the overflow value before being written to disk.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/fs/suid_dumpable</I> (since Linux 2.6.13)

<DD>

The value in this file determines whether core dump files are 
produced for set-user-ID or otherwise protected/tainted binaries.
Three different integer values can be specified:
<P>
<I>0&nbsp;(default)</I>
This provides the traditional (pre-Linux 2.6.13) behaviour.
A core dump will not be produced for a process which has 
changed credentials (by calling
<B><A HREF="../man2/seteuid.2.html">seteuid</A></B>(2),

<B><A HREF="../man2/setgid.2.html">setgid</A></B>(2),

or similar, or by executing a set-user-ID or set-group-ID program) 
or whose binary does not have read permission enabled.
<P>
<I>1&nbsp;(&quot;debug&quot;)</I>
All processes dump core when possible.
The core dump is owned by the file system user ID of the dumping process 
and no security is applied.
This is intended for system debugging situations only.
Ptrace is unchecked.
<P>
<I>2&nbsp;(&quot;suidsafe&quot;)</I>
Any binary which normally would not be dumped (see &quot;0&quot; above) 
is dumped readable by root only. 
This allows the user to remove the core dump file but not to read it.
For security reasons core dumps in this mode will not overwrite one 
another or other files.
This mode is appropriate when administrators are
attempting to debug problems in a normal environment.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/fs/super-max </I>

<DD>
This file 
controls the maximum number of superblocks, and
thus the maximum number of mounted filesystems the kernel

<DD>
This file 
contains three numbers: highwater, lowwater and frequency.
If BSD-style process accounting is enabled these values control
its behaviour. If free space on filesystem where the log lives
goes below lowwater percent accounting suspends. If free space gets
above highwater percent accounting resumes.  Frequency determines
how often the kernel checks the amount of free space (value is in
seconds). Default values are 4, 2 and 30.
That is, suspend accounting if &lt;= 2% of space is free; resume it
if &gt;= 4% of space is free; consider information about amount of free space
valid for 30 seconds.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/kernel/cap-bound</I>

<DD>
This file holds the value of the kernel
<I>capability bounding set</I>

(expressed as a signed decimal number).
This set is ANDed against the capabilities permitted to a process
during 
<B>exec</B>().

<DT><I>/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern</I>

<DD>
This file
(new in Linux 2.5) provides finer control over the form of
a core filename than the obsolete
<I>/proc/sys/kernel/core_uses_pid</I>

file described below.
The name for a core file is controlled by defining a template in
<I>/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern</I>.

The template can contain % specifiers which are substituted
by the following values when a core file is created:
<PRE>
    
  %%  A single % character
  %p  PID of dumped process
  %u  real UID of dumped process
  %g  real GID of dumped process
  %s  number of signal causing dump
  %t  time of dump (secs since 0:00h, 1 Jan 1970)
  %h  hostname (same as the 'nodename' 
      returned by <B><A HREF="../man2/uname.2.html">uname</A></B>(2))
  %e  executable filename
    
</PRE>

A single % at the end of the template is dropped from the 
core filename, as is the combination of a % followed by any 
character other than those listed above.
All other characters in the template become a literal
part of the core filename.
The maximum size of the resulting core filename is 64 bytes.
The default value in this file is &quot;core&quot;.
For backward compatibility, if
<I>/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern</I>

does not include &quot;%p&quot; and
<I>/proc/sys/kernel/core_uses_pid</I>

is non-zero, then .PID will be appended to the core filename.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/kernel/core_uses_pid</I>

<DD>
This file
can be used control the naming of a core dump file on Linux 2.4.
If this file contains the value 0, then a core dump file is simply named
<I>core</I>.

If this file contains a non-zero value, then the core dump file includes
the process ID in a name of the form
<I>core.PID</I>.

<DT><I>/proc/sys/kernel/ctrl-alt-del</I>

<DD>
This file
controls the handling of Ctrl-Alt-Del from the keyboard.
When the value in this file is 0, Ctrl-Alt-Del is trapped and
sent to the
<B><A HREF="../man1/init.1.html">init</A></B>(1)

program to handle a graceful restart.
When the value is &gt; 0, Linux's reaction to a Vulcan
Nerve Pinch (tm) will be an immediate reboot, without even
syncing its dirty buffers.
Note: when a program (like dosemu) has the keyboard in 'raw'
mode, the ctrl-alt-del is intercepted by the program before it
ever reaches the kernel tty layer, and it's up to the program
to decide what to do with it.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/kernel/hotplug</I>

<DD>
This file
contains the path for the hotplug policy agent.
The default value in this file &quot;/sbin/hotplug&quot;.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/kernel/domainname</I> and <I>/proc/sys/kernel/hostname</I>

<DD>
can be used to set the NIS/YP domainname and the
hostname of your box in exactly the same way as the commands
domainname and hostname, i.e.:
<BR>

<P>
<BR>

# echo &quot;darkstar&quot; &gt; /proc/sys/kernel/hostname
<BR>

# echo &quot;mydomain&quot; &gt; /proc/sys/kernel/domainname
<BR>

<P>
<BR>

has the same effect as
<BR>

<P>
<BR>

# hostname &quot;darkstar&quot;
<BR>

# domainname &quot;mydomain&quot;
<BR>

<P>
<BR>

Note, however, that the classic darkstar.frop.org has the
hostname &quot;darkstar&quot; and DNS (Internet Domain Name Server)
domainname &quot;frop.org&quot;, not to be confused with the NIS (Network
Information Service) or YP (Yellow Pages) domainname. These two
domain names are in general different. For a detailed discussion
see the
<B><A HREF="../man1/hostname.1.html">hostname</A></B>(1)

man page.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/kernel/htab-reclaim</I>

<DD>
(PowerPC only) If this file is set to a non-zero value,
the PowerPC htab
(see kernel file Documentation/powerpc/ppc_htab.txt) is pruned
each time the system hits the idle loop.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/kernel/l2cr</I>

<DD>
(PowerPC only) This file
contains a flag that controls the L2 cache of G3 processor
boards. If 0, the cache is disabled. Enabled if non-zero.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/kernel/modprobe</I>

<DD>
This file
is described by the kernel source file Documentation/kmod.txt.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/kernel/msgmax</I>

<DD>
This file defines
a system-wide limit specifying the maximum number of bytes in
a single message written on a System V message queue.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/kernel/msgmni</I>

<DD>
This file defines the system-wide limit on the number of
message queue identifiers.
(This file is only present in Linux 2.4 onwards.)
<DT><I>/proc/sys/kernel/msgmnb</I>

<DD>
This file defines a system-wide parameter used to initialise the
<I>msg_qbytes</I>

setting for subsequently created message queues.
The
<I>msg_qbytes</I>

setting specifies the maximum number of bytes that may be written to the
message queue.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/kernel/ostype</I> and <I>/proc/sys/kernel/osrelease</I>

<DD>
These files
give substrings of
<I>/proc/version</I>.

<DT><I>/proc/sys/kernel/overflowgid</I> and <I>/proc/sys/kernel/overflowuid</I>

<DD>
These files duplicate the files
<I>/proc/sys/fs/overflowgid</I>

and
<I>/proc/sys/fs/overflowuid</I>.

<DT><I>/proc/sys/kernel/panic</I>

<DD>
gives read/write access to the kernel variable
<I>panic_timeout</I>.

If this is zero, the kernel will loop on a panic; if non-zero
it indicates that the kernel should autoreboot after this number
of seconds.  When you use the
software watchdog device driver, the recommended setting is 60.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/kernel/panic_on_oops</I>

<DD>
This file (new in Linux 2.5) controls the kernel's behaviour when an oops 
or
BUG is encountered.  If this file contains 0, then the system
tries to continue operation.  If it contains 1, then the system
delays a few seconds (to give klogd time to record the oops output)
and then panics. 
If the
<I>/proc/sys/kernel/panic</I>

file is also non-zero then the machine will be rebooted.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/kernel/pid_max</I>

<DD>
This file 
(new in Linux 2.5)
specifies the value at which PIDs wrap around
(i.e., the value in this file is one greater than the maximum PID).
The default value for this file, 32768,
results in the same range of PIDs as on earlier kernels.
On 32-bit platfroms, 32768 is the maximum value for 
<I>pid_max</I>.

On 64-bit systems, 
<I>pid_max</I>

can be set to any value up to 2^22
(PID_MAX_LIMIT, approximately 4 million).



<DT><I>/proc/sys/kernel/powersave-nap</I> (PowerPC only)

<DD>
This file
contains a flag.  If set, Linux-PPC will use the 'nap' mode of 
powersaving,
otherwise the 'doze' mode will be used.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/kernel/printk</I>

<DD>
The four values in this file
are console_loglevel, default_message_loglevel, minimum_console_level and
default_console_loglevel.
These values influence printk() behavior when printing or
logging error messages. See
<B><A HREF="../man2/syslog.2.html">syslog</A></B>(2)

for more info on the different loglevels.
Messages with a higher priority than
console_loglevel will be printed to the console.
Messages without an explicit priority
will be printed with priority default_message_level.
minimum_console_loglevel is the minimum (highest) value to which
console_loglevel can be set.
default_console_loglevel is the default value for console_loglevel.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/kernel/pty</I> (since Linux 2.6.4)

<DD>
This directory 
contains two files relating to the number of Unix 98
pseudo-terminals (see
<B><A HREF="../man4/pts.4.html">pts</A></B>(4))

on the system.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/kernel/pty/max</I>

<DD>
This file defines the maximum number of pseudo-terminals.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/kernel/pty/nr</I>

<DD>
This read-only file
indicates how many pseudo-terminals are currently in use.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/kernel/random</I>

<DD>
This directory
contains various parameters controlling the operation of the file
<I>/dev/random</I>.

See 
<B><A HREF="../man4/random.4.html">random</A></B>(4)

for further information.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/kernel/real-root-dev</I>

<DD>
This file
is documented in the kernel source file Documentation/initrd.txt.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/kernel/reboot-cmd</I> (Sparc only) 

<DD>
This file seems to be a way to give an argument to the SPARC
ROM/Flash boot loader. Maybe to tell it what to do after
rebooting?
<DT><I>/proc/sys/kernel/rtsig-max</I>

<DD>
(Only in kernels up to and including 2.6.7; see 
<B><A HREF="../man2/setrlimit.2.html">setrlimit</A></B>(2))

This file can be used to tune the maximum number
of POSIX realtime (queued) signals that can be outstanding
in the system.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/kernel/rtsig-nr</I>

<DD>
(Only in kernels up to and including 2.6.7.)
This file shows the number POSIX realtime signals currently queued.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/kernel/sem</I> (since Linux 2.4)

<DD>
This file contains 4 numbers defining limits for System V IPC semaphores.
These fields are, in order: 
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>SEMMSL<DD>
The maximum semaphores per semaphore set.
<DT>SEMMNS<DD>
A system-wide limit on the number of semaphores in all semaphore sets.
<DT>SEMOPM<DD>
The maximum number of operations that may be specified in a
<B><A HREF="../man2/semop.2.html">semop</A></B>(2)

call.
<DT>SEMMNI<DD>
A system-wide limit on the maximum number of semaphore identifiers.
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><I>/proc/sys/kernel/sg-big-buff</I>

<DD>
This file 
shows the size of the generic SCSI device (sg) buffer.
You can't tune it just yet, but you could change it on
compile time by editing include/scsi/sg.h and changing
the value of SG_BIG_BUFF.  However, there shouldn't be any reason to 
change
this value.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/kernel/shmall</I>

<DD>
This file
contains the system-wide limit on the total number of pages of
System V shared memory.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/kernel/shmmax</I>

<DD>
This file
can be used to query and set the run time limit
on the maximum (System V IPC) shared memory segment size that can be 
created.
Shared memory segments up to 1Gb are now supported in the 
kernel.  This value defaults to SHMMAX.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/kernel/shmmni</I>

<DD>
(available in Linux 2.4 and onwards)
This file
specifies the system-wide maximum number of System V shared memory
segments that can be created.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/kernel/version</I>

<DD>
contains a string like:
<BR>

<P>
<BR>

#5 Wed Feb 25 21:49:24 MET 1998.TP
<BR>

<P>
<BR>

The '#5' means that
this is the fifth kernel built from this source base and the
date behind it indicates the time the kernel was built.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/kernel/zero-paged</I> (PowerPC only) 

<DD>
This file
contains a flag. When enabled (non-zero), Linux-PPC will pre-zero pages in
the idle loop, possibly speeding up get_free_pages.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/net</I>

<DD>
This directory contains networking stuff.
Explanations for some of the files under this directory can be found in
<B><A HREF="../man7/tcp.7.html">tcp</A></B>(7)

and
<B><A HREF="../man7/ip.7.html">ip</A></B>(7).

<DT><I>/proc/sys/proc</I>

<DD>
This directory may be empty.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/sunrpc</I>

<DD>
This directory supports Sun remote procedure call for network file system
(NFS).  On some systems, it is not present.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/vm</I>

<DD>
This directory contains files for memory management tuning, buffer and 
cache
management.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/vm/legacy_va_layout</I> (since Linux 2.6.9)

<DD>

If non-zero, this disable the new 32-bit memory-mapping layout;
the kernel will use the legacy (2.4) layout for all processes.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory</I>

<DD>
This file contains the kernel virtual memory accounting mode. Values are:
<BR>

0: heuristic overcommit (this is the default)
<BR>

1: always overcommit, never check
<BR>

2: always check, never overcommit
<BR>

In mode 0, calls of
<B><A HREF="../man2/mmap.2.html">mmap</A></B>(2)

with MAP_NORESERVE set are not checked, and the default check is very weak,
leading to the risk of getting a process &quot;OOM-killed&quot;.
Under Linux 2.4 any non-zero value implies mode 1.
In mode 2 (available since Linux 2.6), the total virtual address space
on the system is limited to (SS + RAM*(r/100)),
where SS is the size of the swap space, and RAM
is the size of the physical memory, and r is the contents of the file
<I>/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_ratio</I>.

<DT><I>/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_ratio</I>

<DD>
See the description of 
<I>/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory</I>.

<DT><I>/proc/sysvipc</I>

<DD>
Subdirectory containing the pseudo-files 
<I>msg</I>, <I>sem</I> and <I>shm</I>.

These files list the System V Interprocess Communication (IPC) objects 
(respectively: message queues, semaphores, and shared memory)
that currently exist on the system,
providing similar information to that available via
<B><A HREF="../man1/ipcs.1.html">ipcs</A></B>(1).

These files have headers and are formatted (one IPC object per line)
for easy understanding.
<B><A HREF="../man5/ipc.5.html">ipc</A></B>(5)

provides further background on the information shown by these files.
<DT><I>/proc/tty</I>

<DD>
Subdirectory containing the pseudo-files and subdirectories for 
tty drivers and line disciplines.
<DT><I>/proc/uptime</I>

<DD>
This file contains two numbers: the uptime of the system (seconds),
and the amount of time spent in idle process (seconds).
<DT><I>/proc/version</I>

<DD>
This string identifies the kernel version that is currently running.
It includes the contents of /proc/sys/ostype, /proc/sys/osrelease and 
/proc/sys/version.  For example:
<PRE>
Linux version 1.0.9 (<A HREF="mailto:quinlan@phaze">quinlan@phaze</A>) #1 Sat May 14 01:51:54 EDT 1994
</PRE>

<DT><I>/proc/vmstat</I> (since Linux 2.6)

<DD>
This file displays various virtual memory statistics.
<P>
<DT><I>/proc/zoneinfo</I> (since Linux 2.6.13)

<DD>
This file display information about memory zones.
This is useful for analysing virtual memory behaviour.

<H2>CAVEATS</H2>

Note that many strings (i.e., the environment and command line) are in
the internal format, with sub-fields terminated by null bytes ('\0'), 
so you
may find that things are more readable if you use <I>od -c</I> or <I>tr
&quot;\000&quot; &quot;\n&quot;</I> to read them.
Alternatively, <I>echo `cat &lt;file&gt;`</I> works well.
