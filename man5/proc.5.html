<A NAME="lbAB">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NAME</H2>

proc - process information pseudo-file system
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The
<I>proc</I>

file system is a pseudo-file system which is used as an interface to
kernel data structures.
It is commonly mounted at
<I>/proc</I>.

Most of it is read-only, but some files allow kernel variables to be
changed.
<P>

The following outline gives a quick tour through the
<I>/proc</I>

hierarchy.

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><I>/proc/[pid]</I>

<DD>
There is a numerical subdirectory for each running process; the
subdirectory is named by the process ID.
Each such subdirectory contains the following
pseudo-files and directories.






<DT><I>/proc/[pid]/auxv</I> (since 2.6.0-test7)

<DD>
This contains the contents of the ELF interpreter information passed
to the process at exec time.
The format is one <I>unsigned long</I> ID
plus one <I>unsigned long</I> value for each entry.
The last entry contains two zeros.











<DT><I>/proc/[pid]/cmdline</I>

<DD>
This holds the complete command line for the process,
unless the process is a zombie.

In the latter case, there is nothing in this file:
that is, a read on this file will return 0 characters.
The command-line arguments appear in this file as a set of
strings separated by null bytes ('\0'),
with a further null byte after the last string.
<DT><I>/proc/[pid]/coredump_filter</I> (since kernel 2.6.23)

<DD>
See
<B><A HREF="../man5/core.5.html">core</A></B>(5).

<DT><I>/proc/[pid]/cpuset</I> (since kernel 2.6.12)

<DD>

See
<B><A HREF="../man7/cpuset.7.html">cpuset</A></B>(7).

<DT><I>/proc/[pid]/cwd</I>

<DD>
This is a symbolic link to the current working directory of the process.
To find out the current working directory of process 20,
for instance, you can do this:
<P>

<PRE>
$<B> cd /proc/20/cwd; /bin/pwd</B>
</PRE>


<P>
Note that the
<I>pwd</I>

command is often a shell built-in, and might
not work properly.
In
<B><A HREF="../man1/bash.1.html">bash</A></B>(1),

you may use
<I>pwd&nbsp;-P</I>.

<P>

In a multithreaded process, the contents of this symbolic link
are not available if the main thread has already terminated
(typically by calling
<B><A HREF="../man3/pthread_exit.3.html">pthread_exit</A></B>(3)).

<DT><I>/proc/[pid]/environ</I>

<DD>
This file contains the environment for the process.
The entries are separated by null bytes ('\0'),
and there may be a null byte at the end.
Thus, to print out the environment of process 1, you would do:

<PRE>

$<B> (cat /proc/1/environ; echo) | tr '\000' '\n'</B>
</PRE>



<DT><I>/proc/[pid]/exe</I>

<DD>
Under Linux 2.2 and later, this file is a symbolic link
containing the actual pathname of the executed command.
This symbolic link can be dereferenced normally; attempting to open
it will open the executable.
You can even type
<I>/proc/[pid]/exe</I>

to run another copy of the same executable as is being run by
process [pid].

In a multithreaded process, the contents of this symbolic link
are not available if the main thread has already terminated
(typically by calling
<B><A HREF="../man3/pthread_exit.3.html">pthread_exit</A></B>(3)).

<P>
Under Linux 2.0 and earlier
<I>/proc/[pid]/exe</I>

is a pointer to the binary which was executed,
and appears as a symbolic link.
A
<B><A HREF="../man2/readlink.2.html">readlink</A></B>(2)

call on this file under Linux 2.0 returns a string in the format:
<P>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[device]:inode
<P>
For example, [0301]:1502 would be inode 1502 on device major 03 (IDE,
MFM, etc. drives) minor 01 (first partition on the first drive).
<P>
<B><A HREF="../man1/find.1.html">find</A></B>(1)

with the
<I>-inum</I>

option can be used to locate the file.
<DT><I>/proc/[pid]/fd</I>

<DD>
This is a subdirectory containing one entry for each file which the
process has open, named by its file descriptor, and which is a
symbolic link to the actual file.
Thus, 0 is standard input, 1 standard output, 2 standard error, etc.
<P>

In a multithreaded process, the contents of this directory
are not available if the main thread has already terminated
(typically by calling
<B><A HREF="../man3/pthread_exit.3.html">pthread_exit</A></B>(3)).

<P>
Programs that will take a filename as a command-line argument,
but will not take input from standard input if no argument is supplied,
or that write to a file named as a command-line argument,
but will not send their output to standard output
if no argument is supplied, can nevertheless be made to use
standard input or standard out using
<I>/proc/[pid]/fd</I>.

For example, assuming that
<I>-i</I>

is the flag designating an input file and
<I>-o</I>

is the flag designating an output file:

<PRE>

$<B> foobar -i /proc/self/fd/0 -o /proc/self/fd/1 ...</B>
</PRE>


<P>
and you have a working filter.




<P>
<I>/proc/self/fd/N</I>

is approximately the same as
<I>/dev/fd/N</I>

in some UNIX and UNIX-like systems.
Most Linux MAKEDEV scripts symbolically link
<I>/dev/fd</I>

to
<I>/proc/self/fd</I>,

in fact.
<P>
Most systems provide symbolic links
<I>/dev/stdin</I>,

<I>/dev/stdout</I>,

and
<I>/dev/stderr</I>,

which respectively link to the files
<I>0</I>,

<I>1</I>,

and
<I>2</I>

in
<I>/proc/self/fd</I>.

Thus the example command above could be written as:

<PRE>

$<B> foobar -i /dev/stdin -o /dev/stdout ...</B>
</PRE>





<DT><I>/proc/[pid]/fdinfo/</I> (since kernel 2.6.22)

<DD>
This is a subdirectory containing one entry for each file which the
process has open, named by its file descriptor.
The contents of each file can be read to obtain information
about the corresponding file descriptor, for example:

<PRE>

$<B> cat /proc/12015/fdinfo/4</B>
pos:    1000
flags:  01002002
</PRE>


<P>
The
<I>pos</I>

field is a decimal number showing the current file offset.
The
<I>flags</I>

field is an octal number that displays the
file access mode and file status flags (see
<B><A HREF="../man2/open.2.html">open</A></B>(2)).

<P>
The files in this directory are readable only by the owner of the process.



<DT><I>/proc/[pid]/limits</I> (since kernel 2.6.24)

<DD>
This file displays the soft limit, hard limit, and units of measurement
for each of the process's resource limits (see
<B><A HREF="../man2/getrlimit.2.html">getrlimit</A></B>(2)).

The file is protected to only allow reading by the real UID of the process.
<DT><I>/proc/[pid]/maps</I>

<DD>
A file containing the currently mapped memory regions and their access
permissions.
<P>
The format is:
<P>
<PRE>
address           perms offset  dev   inode   pathname
08048000-08056000 r-xp 00000000 03:0c 64593   /usr/sbin/gpm
08056000-08058000 rw-p 0000d000 03:0c 64593   /usr/sbin/gpm
08058000-0805b000 rwxp 00000000 00:00 0
40000000-40013000 r-xp 00000000 03:0c 4165    /lib/ld-2.2.4.so
40013000-40015000 rw-p 00012000 03:0c 4165    /lib/ld-2.2.4.so
4001f000-40135000 r-xp 00000000 03:0c 45494   /lib/libc-2.2.4.so
40135000-4013e000 rw-p 00115000 03:0c 45494   /lib/libc-2.2.4.so
4013e000-40142000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0
bffff000-c0000000 rwxp 00000000 00:00 0
</PRE>

<P>
where &quot;address&quot; is the address space in the process that it occupies,
&quot;perms&quot; is a set of permissions:
<P>
<PRE>
r = read
w = write
x = execute
s = shared
p = private (copy on write)
</PRE>


<P>
&quot;offset&quot; is the offset into the file/whatever, &quot;dev&quot; is the device
(major:minor), and &quot;inode&quot; is the inode on that device.
0 indicates that no inode is associated with the memory region,
as the case would be with BSS (uninitialized data).
<P>
Under Linux 2.0 there is no field giving pathname.
<DT><I>/proc/[pid]/mem</I>

<DD>
This file can be used to access the pages of a process's memory through
<B><A HREF="../man2/open.2.html">open</A></B>(2),

<B><A HREF="../man2/read.2.html">read</A></B>(2),

and
<B><A HREF="../man2/lseek.2.html">lseek</A></B>(2).

<DT><I>/proc/[pid]/mountinfo</I> (since Linux 2.6.26)

<DD>

This file contains information about mount points.
It contains lines of the form:
<PRE>

36 35 98:0 /mnt1 /mnt2 rw,noatime master:1 - ext3 /dev/root rw,errors=continue
(1)(2)(3)   (4)   (5)      (6)      (7)   (8) (9)   (10)         (11)
</PRE>

<DT><DD>
The numbers in parentheses are labels for the descriptions below:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>(1)<DD>
mount ID: unique identifier of the mount (may be reused after
<B><A HREF="../man2/umount.2.html">umount</A></B>(2)).

<DT>(2)<DD>
parent ID: ID of parent mount (or of self for the top of the mount tree).
<DT>(3)<DD>
major:minor: value of
<I>st_dev</I>

for files on file system (see
<B><A HREF="../man2/stat.2.html">stat</A></B>(2)).

<DT>(4)<DD>
root: root of the mount within the file system.
<DT>(5)<DD>
mount point: mount point relative to the process's root.
<DT>(6)<DD>
mount options: per-mount options.
<DT>(7)<DD>
optional fields: zero or more fields of the form &quot;tag[:value]&quot;.
<DT>(8)<DD>
separator: marks the end of the optional fields.
<DT>(9)<DD>
file system type: name of file system in the form &quot;type[.subtype]&quot;.
<DT>(10)<DD>
mount source: file system-specific information or &quot;none&quot;.
<DT>(11)<DD>
super options: per-super block options.
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
Parsers should ignore all unrecognized optional fields.
Currently the possible optional fields are:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>shared:X<DD>
mount is shared in peer group X
<DT>master:X<DD>
mount is slave to peer group X
<DT>propagate_from:X<DD>
mount is slave and receives propagation from peer group X (*)
<DT>unbindable<DD>
mount is unbindable
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
(*) X is the closest dominant peer group under the process's root.
If X is the immediate master of the mount,
or if there is no dominant peer group under the same root,
then only the &quot;master:X&quot; field is present
and not the &quot;propagate_from:X&quot; field.
<P>
For more information on mount propagation see:
<I>Documentation/filesystems/sharedsubtree.txt</I>

in the kernel source tree.
<DT><I>/proc/[pid]/mounts</I> (since Linux 2.4.19)

<DD>
This is a list of all the file systems currently mounted in the
process's mount namespace.
The format of this file is documented in
<B><A HREF="../man5/fstab.5.html">fstab</A></B>(5).

Since kernel version 2.6.15, this file is pollable:
after opening the file for reading, a change in this file
(i.e., a file system mount or unmount) causes
<B><A HREF="../man2/select.2.html">select</A></B>(2)

to mark the file descriptor as readable, and
<B><A HREF="../man2/poll.2.html">poll</A></B>(2)

and
<B><A HREF="../man2/epoll_wait.2.html">epoll_wait</A></B>(2)

mark the file as having an error condition.
<DT><I>/proc/[pid]/mountstats</I> (since Linux 2.6.17)

<DD>
This file exports information (statistics, configuration information)
about the mount points in the process's name space.
Lines in this file have the form:
<PRE>

device /dev/sda7 mounted on /home with fstype ext3 [statistics]
(       1      )            ( 2 )             (3 ) (4)
</PRE>

<DT><DD>
The fields in each line are:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>(1)<DD>
The name of the mounted device
(or &quot;nodevice&quot; if there is no corresponding device).
<DT>(2)<DD>
The mount point within the file system tree.
<DT>(3)<DD>
The file system type.
<DT>(4)<DD>
Optional statistics and configuration information.
Currently (as at Linux 2.6.26), only NFS file systems export
information via this field.
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
This file is only readable by the owner of the process.
<DT><I>/proc/[pid]/ns/</I> (since Linux 3.0)

<DD>

This is a subdirectory containing one entry for each namespace that
supports being manipulated by
<B><A HREF="../man2/setns.2.html">setns</A></B>(2).

For information about namespaces, see
<B><A HREF="../man2/clone.2.html">clone</A></B>(2).

<DT><I>/proc/[pid]/ns/ipc</I> (since Linux 3.0)

<DD>
Bind mounting this file (see
<B><A HREF="../man2/mount.2.html">mount</A></B>(2))

to somewhere else in the filesystem keeps
the IPC namespace of the process specified by
<I>pid</I>

alive even if all processes currently in the namespace terminate.
<P>
Opening this file returns a file handle for the IPC namespace
of the process specified by
<I>pid</I>.

As long as this file descriptor remains open,
the IPC namespace will remain alive,
even if all processes in the namespace terminate.
The file descriptor can be passed to
<B><A HREF="../man2/setns.2.html">setns</A></B>(2).

<DT><I>/proc/[pid]/ns/net</I> (since Linux 3.0)

<DD>
Bind mounting this file (see
<B><A HREF="../man2/mount.2.html">mount</A></B>(2))

to somewhere else in the filesystem keeps
the network namespace of the process specified by
<I>pid</I>

alive even if all processes in the namespace terminate.
<P>
Opening this file returns a file handle for the network namespace
of the process specified by
<I>pid</I>.

As long as this file descriptor remains open,
the network namespace will remain alive,
even if all processes in the namespace terminate.
The file descriptor can be passed to
<B><A HREF="../man2/setns.2.html">setns</A></B>(2).

<DT><I>/proc/[pid]/ns/uts</I> (since Linux 3.0)

<DD>
Bind mounting this file (see
<B><A HREF="../man2/mount.2.html">mount</A></B>(2))

to somewhere else in the filesystem keeps
the UTS namespace of the process specified by
<I>pid</I>

alive even if all processes currently in the namespace terminate.
<P>
Opening this file returns a file handle for the UTS namespace
of the process specified by
<I>pid</I>.

As long as this file descriptor remains open,
the UTS namespace will remain alive,
even if all processes in the namespace terminate.
The file descriptor can be passed to
<B><A HREF="../man2/setns.2.html">setns</A></B>(2).

<DT><I>/proc/[pid]/numa_maps</I> (since Linux 2.6.14)

<DD>
See
<B><A HREF="../man7/numa.7.html">numa</A></B>(7).

<DT><I>/proc/[pid]/oom_adj</I> (since Linux 2.6.11)

<DD>
This file can be used to adjust the score used to select which process
should be killed in an out-of-memory (OOM) situation.
The kernel uses this value for a bit-shift operation of the process's
<I>oom_score</I>

value:
valid values are in the range -16 to +15,
plus the special value -17,
which disables OOM-killing altogether for this process.
A positive score increases the likelihood of this
process being killed by the OOM-killer;
a negative score decreases the likelihood.
The default value for this file is 0;
a new process inherits its parent's
<I>oom_adj</I>

setting.
A process must be privileged
(<B>CAP_SYS_RESOURCE</B>)

to update this file.
<DT><I>/proc/[pid]/oom_score</I> (since Linux 2.6.11)

<DD>

This file displays the current score that the kernel gives to
this process for the purpose of selecting a process
for the OOM-killer.
A higher score means that the process is more likely to be
selected by the OOM-killer.
The basis for this score is the amount of memory used by the process,
with increases (+) or decreases (-) for factors including:

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
whether the process creates a lot of children using
<B><A HREF="../man2/fork.2.html">fork</A></B>(2)

(+);
<DT>*<DD>
whether the process has been running a long time,
or has used a lot of CPU time (-);
<DT>*<DD>
whether the process has a low nice value (i.e., &gt; 0) (+);
<DT>*<DD>
whether the process is privileged (-); and

<DT>*<DD>
whether the process is making direct hardware access (-).

</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
The
<I>oom_score</I>

also reflects the bit-shift adjustment specified by the
<I>oom_adj</I>

setting for the process.



<DT><I>/proc/[pid]/root</I>

<DD>
UNIX and Linux support the idea of a per-process root of the
file system, set by the
<B><A HREF="../man2/chroot.2.html">chroot</A></B>(2)

system call.
This file is a symbolic link that points to the process's
root directory, and behaves as exe, fd/*, etc. do.
<P>

In a multithreaded process, the contents of this symbolic link
are not available if the main thread has already terminated
(typically by calling
<B><A HREF="../man3/pthread_exit.3.html">pthread_exit</A></B>(3)).















<DT><I>/proc/[pid]/smaps</I> (since Linux 2.6.14)

<DD>

This file shows memory consumption for each of the process's mappings.
For each of mappings there is a series of lines such as the following:

<PRE>

08048000-080bc000 r-xp 00000000 03:02 13130      /bin/bash
Size:               464 kB
Rss:                424 kB
Shared_Clean:       424 kB
Shared_Dirty:         0 kB
Private_Clean:        0 kB
Private_Dirty:        0 kB

</PRE>


The first of these lines shows the same information as is displayed
for the mapping in
<I>/proc/[pid]/maps</I>.

The remaining lines show the size of the mapping,
the amount of the mapping that is currently resident in RAM,
the number of clean and dirty shared pages in the mapping,
and the number of clean and dirty private pages in the mapping.
<P>
This file is only present if the
<B>CONFIG_MMU</B>

kernel configuration
option is enabled.
<DT><I>/proc/[pid]/stat</I>

<DD>
Status information about the process.
This is used by
<B><A HREF="../man1/ps.1.html">ps</A></B>(1).

It is defined in
<I>/usr/src/linux/fs/proc/array.c</I>.

<P>
The fields, in order, with their proper
<B><A HREF="../man3/scanf.3.html">scanf</A></B>(3)

<DT><I>comm</I> %s<DD>
The filename of the executable, in parentheses.
This is visible whether or not the executable is swapped out.
<DT><I>state</I> %c<DD>
One character from the string &quot;RSDZTW&quot; where R is running, S is
sleeping in an interruptible wait, D is waiting in uninterruptible
disk sleep, Z is zombie, T is traced or stopped (on a signal),
and W is paging.
<DT><I>ppid</I> %d<DD>

The session ID of the process.
<DT><I>tty_nr</I> %d<DD>
The controlling terminal of the process.
(The minor device number is contained in the combination of bits
31 to 20 and 7 to 0;
the major device number is in bits 15 to 8.)
<DT><I>tpgid</I> %d<DD>

The ID of the foreground process group of the controlling
terminal of the process.
<DT><I>flags</I> %u (%lu before Linux 2.6.22)<DD>
The kernel flags word of the process.
For bit meanings,
see the PF_* defines in
<I>&lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/linux/sched.h">linux/sched.h</A>&gt;</I>.

Details depend on the kernel version.
<DT><I>minflt</I> %lu<DD>
The number of minor faults the process has made which have not
required loading a memory page from disk.
<DT>
<DD>
<I>cminflt</I> %lu
The number of minor faults that the process's
waited-for children have made.
<DT><I>majflt</I> %lu<DD>
The number of major faults the process has made which have
required loading a memory page from disk.
<DT><I>cmajflt</I> %lu<DD>
The number of major faults that the process's
waited-for children have made.
<DT><I>utime</I> %lu<DD>
Amount of time that this process has been scheduled in user mode,
measured in clock ticks (divide by
<I>sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK)</I>.

This includes guest time, <I>guest_time</I>
(time spent running a virtual CPU, see below),
so that applications that are not aware of the guest time field
do not lose that time from their calculations.
<DT><I>stime</I> %lu<DD>
Amount of time that this process has been scheduled in kernel mode,
measured in clock ticks (divide by
<I>sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK)</I>.

<DT><I>cutime</I> %ld<DD>
Amount of time that this process's
waited-for children have been scheduled in user mode,
measured in clock ticks (divide by
<I>sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK)</I>.

(See also
<B><A HREF="../man2/times.2.html">times</A></B>(2).)

This includes guest time, <I>cguest_time</I>
(time spent running a virtual CPU, see below).
<DT><I>cstime</I> %ld<DD>
Amount of time that this process's
waited-for children have been scheduled in kernel mode,
measured in clock ticks (divide by
<I>sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK)</I>.

<DT><I>priority</I> %ld<DD>
(Explanation for Linux 2.6)
For processes running a real-time scheduling policy
(<I>policy</I>

below; see
<B><A HREF="../man2/sched_setscheduler.2.html">sched_setscheduler</A></B>(2)),

this is the negated scheduling priority, minus one;
that is, a number in the range -2 to -100,
corresponding to real-time priorities 1 to 99.
For processes running under a non-real-time scheduling policy,
this is the raw nice value
(<B><A HREF="../man2/setpriority.2.html">setpriority</A></B>(2))

as represented in the kernel.
The kernel stores nice values as numbers
in the range 0 (high) to 39 (low),
corresponding to the user-visible nice range of -20 to 19.
<P>
Before Linux 2.6, this was a scaled value based on
the scheduler weighting given to this process.

<DT><I>nice</I> %ld<DD>
The nice value (see
<B><A HREF="../man2/setpriority.2.html">setpriority</A></B>(2)),

a value in the range 19 (low priority) to -20 (high priority).

<DT>
<DD>








<I>num_threads</I> %ld
Number of threads in this process (since Linux 2.6).
Before kernel 2.6, this field was hard coded to 0 as a placeholder
for an earlier removed field.
<DT>
<DD>
<I>itrealvalue</I> %ld
The time in jiffies before the next
<B>SIGALRM</B>

<DT><I>/proc/[pid]/task</I> (since Linux 2.6.0-test6)

<DD>
This is a directory that contains one subdirectory
for each thread in the process.
The name of each subdirectory is the numerical thread ID
(<I>[tid]</I>)

of the thread (see
<B><A HREF="../man2/gettid.2.html">gettid</A></B>(2)).

Within each of these subdirectories, there is a set of
files with the same names and contents as under the
<I>/proc/[pid]</I>

directories.
For attributes that are shared by all threads, the contents for
each of the files under the
<I>task/[tid]</I>

subdirectories will be the same as in the corresponding
file in the parent
<I>/proc/[pid]</I>

directory
(e.g., in a multithreaded process, all of the
<I>task/[tid]/cwd</I>

files will have the same value as the
<I>/proc/[pid]/cwd</I>

file in the parent directory, since all of the threads in a process
share a working directory).
For attributes that are distinct for each thread,
the corresponding files under
<I>task/[tid]</I>

may have different values (e.g., various fields in each of the
<I>task/[tid]/status</I>

files may be different for each thread).
<P>

In a multithreaded process, the contents of the
<I>/proc/[pid]/task</I>

directory are not available if the main thread has already terminated
(typically by calling
<B><A HREF="../man3/pthread_exit.3.html">pthread_exit</A></B>(3)).

information about PCI busses, installed devices, and device
drivers.
Some of these files are not ASCII.
<DT><I>/proc/bus/pci/devices</I>

<DD>

They may be accessed through
<B><A HREF="../man8/lspci.8.html">lspci</A></B>(8)

and
<B><A HREF="../man8/setpci.8.html">setpci</A></B>(8).

<DT><I>/proc/cmdline</I>

<DD>
Arguments passed to the Linux kernel at boot time.
Often done via a boot manager such as
<B><A HREF="../man8/lilo.8.html">lilo</A></B>(8)

or
<B><A HREF="../man8/grub.8.html">grub</A></B>(8).

<DT><I>/proc/config.gz</I> (since Linux 2.6)

<DD>
This file exposes the configuration options that were used
to build the currently running kernel,
in the same format as they would be shown in the
<I>.config</I>

file that resulted when configuring the kernel (using
<I>make xconfig</I>,

<I>make config</I>,

or similar).
The file contents are compressed; view or search them using
<B><A HREF="../man1/zcat.1.html">zcat</A></B>(1),

<B><A HREF="../man1/zgrep.1.html">zgrep</A></B>(1),

etc.
As long as no changes have been made to the following file,
the contents of
<I>/proc/config.gz</I>

are the same as those provided by :

<PRE>

cat /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/build/.config
</PRE>


<DT><DD>
<I>/proc/config.gz</I>

is only provided if the kernel is configured with
<B>CONFIG_IKCONFIG_PROC</B>.

<DT><I>/proc/cpuinfo</I>

<DD>
This is a collection of CPU and system architecture dependent items,
for each supported architecture a different list.
Two common entries are <I>processor</I> which gives CPU number and
<I>bogomips</I>; a system constant that is calculated
during kernel initialization.
SMP machines have information for
each CPU.
<DT><I>/proc/devices</I>

<DD>
Text listing of major numbers and device groups.
This can be used by MAKEDEV scripts for consistency with the kernel.
<DT><I>/proc/diskstats</I> (since Linux 2.5.69)

modules are currently loaded.
(See also
<B><A HREF="../man5/filesystems.5.html">filesystems</A></B>(5).)

If a file system is marked with &quot;nodev&quot;,
this means that it does not require a block device to be mounted
(e.g., virtual file system, network file system).
<P>
Incidentally, this file may be used by
<B><A HREF="../man8/mount.8.html">mount</A></B>(8)

when no file system is specified and it didn't manage to determine the
file system type.
Then file systems contained in this file are tried
(excepted those that are marked with &quot;nodev&quot;).
<DT><I>/proc/fs</I>

<DD>
Empty subdirectory.
<DT><I>/proc/ide</I>

<DD>

The
<B><A HREF="../man8/hdparm.8.html">hdparm</A></B>(8)

utility provides access to this information in a friendly format.
<DT><I>/proc/interrupts</I>

<DD>
This is used to record the number of interrupts per CPU per IO device.
Since Linux 2.6.24,
for the i386 and x86_64 architectures, at least, this also includes
interrupts internal to the system (that is, not associated with a device
as such), such as NMI (nonmaskable interrupt), LOC (local timer interrupt),
and for SMP systems, TLB (TLB flush interrupt), RES (rescheduling
interrupt), CAL (remote function call interrupt), and possibly others.
Very easy to read formatting, done in ASCII.
<DT><I>/proc/iomem</I>

<DD>
I/O memory map in Linux 2.4.
<DT><I>/proc/ioports</I>

<DD>
This is a list of currently registered Input-Output port regions that
are in use.
<DT><I>/proc/kallsyms</I> (since Linux 2.5.71)

<DD>
This holds the kernel exported symbol definitions used by the
<B>modules</B>(X)

tools to dynamically link and bind loadable modules.
In Linux 2.5.47 and earlier, a similar file with slightly different syntax
was named
<I>ksyms</I>.

<DT><I>/proc/kcore</I>

<DD>
This file represents the physical memory of the system and is stored
in the ELF core file format.
With this pseudo-file, and an unstripped
kernel
(<I>/usr/src/linux/vmlinux</I>)

binary, GDB can be used to
examine the current state of any kernel data structures.
<P>
The total length of the file is the size of physical memory (RAM) plus
4KB.
<DT><I>/proc/kmsg</I>

<DD>
This file can be used instead of the
<B><A HREF="../man2/syslog.2.html">syslog</A></B>(2)

system call to read kernel messages.
A process must have superuser
privileges to read this file, and only one process should read this
file.
This file should not be read if a syslog process is running
which uses the
<B><A HREF="../man2/syslog.2.html">syslog</A></B>(2)

system call facility to log kernel messages.
<P>
Information in this file is retrieved with the
<B><A HREF="../man1/dmesg.1.html">dmesg</A></B>(1)

program.
<DT><I>/proc/ksyms</I> (Linux 1.1.23-2.5.47)

<DD>
See
<I>/proc/kallsyms</I>.

<DT><I>/proc/loadavg</I>

<DD>
The first three fields in this file are load average figures
giving the number of jobs in the run queue (state R)
or waiting for disk I/O (state D) averaged over 1, 5, and 15 minutes.
They are the same as the load average numbers given by
<B><A HREF="../man1/uptime.1.html">uptime</A></B>(1)

and other programs.
The fourth field consists of two numbers separated by a slash (/).
The first of these is the number of currently runnable kernel
scheduling entities (processes, threads).
The value after the slash is the number of kernel scheduling entities
that currently exist on the system.
The fifth field is the PID of the process that was most
recently created on the system.
<DT><I>/proc/locks</I>

<DD>
This file shows current file locks
(<B><A HREF="../man2/flock.2.html">flock</A></B>(2) and <B><A HREF="../man2/fcntl.2.html">fcntl</A></B>(2))

and leases
(<B><A HREF="../man2/fcntl.2.html">fcntl</A></B>(2)).

<DT><I>/proc/malloc</I> (only up to and including Linux 2.2)

<DD>

This file is only present if
<B>CONFIG_DEBUG_MALLOC</B>

was defined during compilation.
<DT><I>/proc/meminfo</I>

<DD>
This file reports statistics about memory usage on the system.
It is used by
<B><A HREF="../man1/free.1.html">free</A></B>(1)

to report the amount of free and used memory (both physical and swap)
on the system as well as the shared memory and buffers used by the
kernel.
<DT><I>/proc/modules</I>

<DD>
A text list of the modules that have been loaded by the system.
See also
<B><A HREF="../man8/lsmod.8.html">lsmod</A></B>(8).

<DT><I>/proc/mounts</I>

<DD>
Before kernel 2.4.19, this file was a list
of all the file systems currently mounted on the system.
With the introduction of per-process mount namespaces in
Linux 2.4.19, this file became a link to
<I>/proc/self/mounts</I>,

which lists the mount points of the process's own mount namespace.
The format of this file is documented in
<B><A HREF="../man5/fstab.5.html">fstab</A></B>(5).

<DT><I>/proc/mtrr</I>

<DD>
Memory Type Range Registers.
See the kernel source file
<I>Documentation/mtrr.txt</I>

for details.
<DT><I>/proc/net</I>

<DD>
various net pseudo-files, all of which give the status of some part of
the networking layer.
These files contain ASCII structures and are,
therefore, readable with
<B><A HREF="../man1/cat.1.html">cat</A></B>(1).

However, the standard
<B><A HREF="../man8/netstat.8.html">netstat</A></B>(8)

suite provides much cleaner access to these files.
<DT><I>/proc/net/arp</I>

<DD>
This holds an ASCII readable dump of the kernel ARP table used for
address resolutions.
It will show both dynamically learned and preprogrammed ARP entries.
The format is:
<P>
<PRE>
IP address     HW type   Flags     HW address          Mask   Device
192.168.0.50   0x1       0x2       00:50:BF:25:68:F3   *      eth0
192.168.0.250  0x1       0xc       00:00:00:00:00:00   *      eth0
</PRE>


<P>
Here &quot;IP address&quot; is the IPv4 address of the machine and the &quot;HW type&quot;
is the hardware type of the address from RFC&nbsp;826.
The flags are the internal
flags of the ARP structure (as defined in
<I>/usr/include/linux/if_arp.h</I>)

and
the &quot;HW address&quot; is the data link layer mapping for that IP address if
it is known.
<DT><I>/proc/net/dev</I>

<DD>
The dev pseudo-file contains network device status information.
This gives
the number of received and sent packets, the number of errors and
collisions
and other basic statistics.
These are used by the
<B><A HREF="../man8/ifconfig.8.html">ifconfig</A></B>(8)

program to report device status.
The format is:
<P>

<DT><I>/proc/net/rarp</I>

<DD>
This file uses the same format as the
<I>arp</I>

file and contains the current reverse mapping database used to provide
<B><A HREF="../man8/rarp.8.html">rarp</A></B>(8)

reverse address lookup services.
If RARP is not configured into the
kernel,
this file will not be present.
<DT><I>/proc/net/raw</I>

<DD>
Holds a dump of the RAW socket table.
Much of the information is not of
use
apart from debugging.
The &quot;sl&quot; value is the kernel hash slot for the
socket,
the &quot;local_address&quot; is the local address and protocol number pair.
&quot;St&quot; is
the internal status of the socket.
The &quot;tx_queue&quot; and &quot;rx_queue&quot; are the
outgoing and incoming data queue in terms of kernel memory usage.
The &quot;tr&quot;, &quot;tm-&gt;when&quot;, and &quot;rexmits&quot; fields are not used by RAW.
The &quot;uid&quot;
field holds the effective UID of the creator of the socket.




<DT><I>/proc/net/snmp</I>

<DD>
This file holds the ASCII data needed for the IP, ICMP, TCP, and UDP
management
information bases for an SNMP agent.
<DT><I>/proc/net/tcp</I>

<DD>
Holds a dump of the TCP socket table.
Much of the information is not
of use apart from debugging.
The &quot;sl&quot; value is the kernel hash slot
for the socket, the &quot;local_address&quot; is the local address and port number pair.
The &quot;rem_address&quot; is the remote address and port number pair
(if connected).
&quot;St&quot; is the internal status of the socket.
The &quot;tx_queue&quot; and &quot;rx_queue&quot; are the
outgoing and incoming data queue in terms of kernel memory usage.
The &quot;tr&quot;, &quot;tm-&gt;when&quot;, and &quot;rexmits&quot; fields hold internal information of
the kernel socket state and are only useful for debugging.
The &quot;uid&quot;
field holds the effective UID of the creator of the socket.
<DT><I>/proc/net/udp</I>

<DD>
Holds a dump of the UDP socket table.
Much of the information is not of

</PRE>

<P>
Here &quot;Num&quot; is the kernel table slot number, &quot;RefCount&quot; is the number
of users of the socket, &quot;Protocol&quot; is currently always 0, &quot;Flags&quot;
represent the internal kernel flags holding the status of the
socket.
Currently, type is always &quot;1&quot; (UNIX domain datagram sockets are
not yet supported in the kernel).
&quot;St&quot; is the internal state of the
socket and Path is the bound path (if any) of the socket.
<DT><I>/proc/partitions</I>

<DD>
Contains major and minor numbers of each partition as well as number
of blocks and partition name.
<DT><I>/proc/pci</I>

<DD>
This is a listing of all PCI devices found during kernel initialization
and their configuration.
<P>
This file has been deprecated in favor of a new
<I>/proc</I>

interface for PCI
(<I>/proc/bus/pci</I>).

It became optional in Linux 2.2 (available with
<B>CONFIG_PCI_OLD_PROC</B>

set at kernel compilation).
It became once more nonoptionally enabled in Linux 2.4.
Next, it was deprecated in Linux 2.6 (still available with
<B>CONFIG_PCI_LEGACY_PROC</B>

set), and finally removed altogether since Linux 2.6.17.




<DT><I>/proc/scsi</I>

<DD>
A directory with the
<I>scsi</I>

mid-level pseudo-file and various SCSI low-level
driver directories,
which contain a file for each SCSI host in this system, all of
which give the status of some part of the SCSI IO subsystem.
These files contain ASCII structures and are, therefore, readable with
<B><A HREF="../man1/cat.1.html">cat</A></B>(1).

<P>
You can also write to some of the files to reconfigure the subsystem or
switch certain features on or off.
<DT><I>/proc/scsi/scsi</I>

<DD>
This is a listing of all SCSI devices known to the kernel.
The listing is similar to the one seen during bootup.
scsi currently supports only the <I>add-single-device</I> command which
allows root to add a hotplugged device to the list of known devices.
<P>
The command

<PRE>

echo 'scsi add-single-device 1 0 5 0' &gt; /proc/scsi/scsi

</PRE>


will cause
host scsi1 to scan on SCSI channel 0 for a device on ID 5 LUN 0.
If there
is already a device known on this address or the address is invalid, an
error will be returned.
<DT><I>/proc/scsi/[drivername]</I>

<DD>
<I>[drivername]</I> can currently be NCR53c7xx, aha152x, aha1542, aha1740,
aic7xxx, buslogic, eata_dma, eata_pio, fdomain, in2000, pas16, qlogic,
scsi_debug, seagate, t128, u15-24f, ultrastore, or wd7000.
These directories show up for all drivers that registered at least one
SCSI HBA.
Every directory contains one file per registered host.
Every host-file is named after the number the host was assigned during
initialization.
<P>
Reading these files will usually show driver and host configuration,
statistics, etc.
<P>
Writing to these files allows different things on different hosts.
For example, with the <I>latency</I> and <I>nolatency</I> commands,
root can switch on and off command latency measurement code in the
eata_dma driver.
With the <I>lockup</I> and <I>unlock</I> commands,
root can control bus lockups simulated by the scsi_debug driver.
<DT><I>/proc/self</I>

<I>sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK)</I>

to obtain the right value),

that the system spent in user mode,
user mode with low priority (nice), system mode, and the
idle task, respectively.


The last value should be USER_HZ times the
second entry in the uptime pseudo-file.
<P>
In Linux 2.6 this line includes three additional columns:
<I>iowait</I>

<I>softirq</I>

- time servicing softirqs (since 2.6.0-test4).
<P>
Since Linux 2.6.11, there is an eighth column,
<I>steal</I>

- stolen time, which is the time spent in other operating systems when
running in a virtualized environment
<P>
Since Linux 2.6.24, there is a ninth column,
<I>guest</I>,

which is the time spent running a virtual CPU for guest
operating systems under the control of the Linux kernel.

<DT><I>page 5741 1808</I><DD>

<B><A HREF="../man2/sysctl.2.html">sysctl</A></B>(2)

system call.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/abi</I> (since Linux 2.4.10)

<DT><I>/proc/sys/debug</I>

<DD>
This directory may be empty.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/dev</I>

<DD>
This directory contains device-specific information (e.g.,
<I>dev/cdrom/info</I>).

On
some systems, it may be empty.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/fs</I>

<DT><I>/proc/sys/fs/dentry-state</I> (since Linux 2.2)

<DD>
This file contains information about the status of the
directory cache (dcache).
The file contains six numbers,
<I>nr_dentry</I>, <I>nr_unused</I>, <I>age_limit</I> (age in seconds), 

<I>want_pages</I>

(pages requested by system) and two dummy values.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
<I>nr_dentry</I>

<DT>*<DD>
<I>nr_unused</I>

is the number of unused dentries.
<DT>*<DD>
<I>age_limit</I>


is the age in seconds after which dcache entries
can be reclaimed when memory is short.
<DT>*<DD>
<I>want_pages</I>


is nonzero when the kernel has called shrink_dcache_pages() and the
dcache isn't pruned yet.
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><I>/proc/sys/fs/dir-notify-enable</I>

<DD>
This file can be used to disable or enable the
<I>dnotify</I>

interface described in
<B><A HREF="../man2/fcntl.2.html">fcntl</A></B>(2)

on a system-wide basis.
A value of 0 in this file disables the interface,
and a value of 1 enables it.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/fs/dquot-max</I>

<DD>
This file shows the maximum number of cached disk quota entries.
On some (2.4) systems, it is not present.
If the number of free cached disk quota entries is very low and
you have some awesome number of simultaneous system users,
you might want to raise the limit.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/fs/dquot-nr</I>

<DD>
This file shows the number of allocated disk quota
entries and the number of free disk quota entries.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/fs/epoll</I> (since Linux 2.6.28)

<DD>
This directory contains the file
<I>max_user_watches</I>,

which can be used to limit the amount of kernel memory consumed by the
<I>epoll</I>

interface.
For further details, see
<B><A HREF="../man7/epoll.7.html">epoll</A></B>(7).

<DT><I>/proc/sys/fs/file-max</I>

<DD>
This file defines
a system-wide limit on the number of open files for all processes.
(See also
<B><A HREF="../man2/setrlimit.2.html">setrlimit</A></B>(2),

which can be used by a process to set the per-process limit,
<B>RLIMIT_NOFILE</B>,

on the number of files it may open.)
If you get lots
of error messages about running out of file handles,
try increasing this value:
<BR>

<P>
<BR>

<PRE>
echo 100000 &gt; /proc/sys/fs/file-max
</PRE>


<P>
The kernel constant
<B>NR_OPEN</B>

imposes an upper limit on the value that may be placed in
<I>file-max</I>.

<P>
If you increase
<I>/proc/sys/fs/file-max</I>,

be sure to increase
<I>/proc/sys/fs/inode-max</I>

to 3-4 times the new
value of
<I>/proc/sys/fs/file-max</I>,

or you will run out of inodes.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/fs/file-nr</I>

<DD>
This (read-only) file gives the number of files presently opened.
It contains three numbers: the number of allocated file handles;
the number of free file handles; and the maximum number of file handles.
The kernel allocates file handles dynamically, but it
doesn't free them again.
If the number of allocated files is close to the
maximum, you should consider increasing the maximum.
When the number of free file handles is
large, you've encountered a peak in your usage of file
handles and you probably don't need to increase the maximum.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/fs/inode-max</I>

<DD>
This file contains the maximum number of in-memory inodes.
On some (2.4) systems, it may not be present.
This value should be 3-4 times larger
than the value in
<I>file-max</I>,

since <I>stdin</I>, <I>stdout</I>
and network sockets also need an inode to handle them.
When you regularly run out of inodes, you need to increase this value.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/fs/inode-nr</I>

<DD>
This file contains the first two values from
<I>inode-state</I>.

<DT><I>/proc/sys/fs/inode-state</I>

<DD>
This file
contains seven numbers:
<I>nr_inodes</I>,

<I>nr_free_inodes</I>,

<I>preshrink</I>,

and four dummy values.
<I>nr_inodes</I>

is the number of inodes the system has allocated.
This can be slightly more than
<I>inode-max</I>

because Linux allocates them one page full at a time.
<I>nr_free_inodes</I>

represents the number of free inodes.
<I>preshrink</I>

is nonzero when the
<I>nr_inodes</I>

&gt;
<I>inode-max</I>

and the system needs to prune the inode list instead of allocating more.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/fs/inotify</I> (since Linux 2.6.13)

<DD>
This directory contains files
<I>max_queued_events</I>, <I>max_user_instances</I>, and <I>max_user_watches</I>,

that can be used to limit the amount of kernel memory consumed by the
<I>inotify</I>

interface.
For further details, see
<B><A HREF="../man7/inotify.7.html">inotify</A></B>(7).

<DT><I>/proc/sys/fs/lease-break-time</I>

<DD>
This file specifies the grace period that the kernel grants to a process
holding a file lease
(<B><A HREF="../man2/fcntl.2.html">fcntl</A></B>(2))

after it has sent a signal to that process notifying it
that another process is waiting to open the file.
If the lease holder does not remove or downgrade the lease within
this grace period, the kernel forcibly breaks the lease.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/fs/leases-enable</I>

<DD>
This file can be used to enable or disable file leases
(<B><A HREF="../man2/fcntl.2.html">fcntl</A></B>(2))

on a system-wide basis.
If this file contains the value 0, leases are disabled.
A nonzero value enables leases.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/fs/mqueue</I> (since Linux 2.6.6)

<DD>
This directory contains files
<I>msg_max</I>, <I>msgsize_max</I>, and <I>queues_max</I>,

controlling the resources used by POSIX message queues.
See
<B><A HREF="../man7/mq_overview.7.html">mq_overview</A></B>(7)

for details.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/fs/overflowgid</I> and <I>/proc/sys/fs/overflowuid</I>

<DD>
These files
allow you to change the value of the fixed UID and GID.
The default is 65534.
Some file systems only support 16-bit UIDs and GIDs, although in Linux
UIDs and GIDs are 32 bits.
When one of these file systems is mounted
with writes enabled, any UID or GID that would exceed 65535 is translated
to the overflow value before being written to disk.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/fs/pipe-max-size</I> (since Linux 2.6.35)

<DD>
The value in this file defines an upper limit for raising the capacity
of a pipe using the
<B><A HREF="../man2/fcntl.2.html">fcntl</A></B>(2)

<B>F_SETPIPE_SZ</B>

operation.
This limit applies only to unprivileged processes.
The default value for this file is 1,048,576.
The value assigned to this file may be rounded upward,
to reflect the value actually employed for a convenient implementation.
To determine the rounded-up value,
display the contents of this file after assigning a value to it.
The minimum value that can be assigned to this file is the system page size.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/fs/suid_dumpable</I> (since Linux 2.6.13)

<DD>

The value in this file determines whether core dump files are
produced for set-user-ID or otherwise protected/tainted binaries.
Three different integer values can be specified:
<P>
<I>0&nbsp;(default)</I>
This provides the traditional (pre-Linux 2.6.13) behavior.
A core dump will not be produced for a process which has
changed credentials (by calling
<B><A HREF="../man2/seteuid.2.html">seteuid</A></B>(2),

<B><A HREF="../man2/setgid.2.html">setgid</A></B>(2),

or similar, or by executing a set-user-ID or set-group-ID program)
or whose binary does not have read permission enabled.
<P>
<I>1&nbsp;(&quot;debug&quot;)</I>
All processes dump core when possible.
The core dump is owned by the file system user ID of the dumping process
and no security is applied.
This is intended for system debugging situations only.
Ptrace is unchecked.
<P>
<I>2&nbsp;(&quot;suidsafe&quot;)</I>
Any binary which normally would not be dumped (see &quot;0&quot; above)
is dumped readable by root only.
This allows the user to remove the core dump file but not to read it.
For security reasons core dumps in this mode will not overwrite one
another or other files.
This mode is appropriate when administrators are
attempting to debug problems in a normal environment.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/fs/super-max</I>

<DD>
This file
controls the maximum number of superblocks, and
thus the maximum number of mounted file systems the kernel
can have.
You only need to increase
<I>super-max</I>

if you need to mount more file systems than the current value in
<I>super-max</I>

allows you to.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/fs/super-nr</I>

<DD>
This file
contains the number of file systems currently mounted.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/kernel</I>

<DD>
This directory contains files controlling a range of kernel parameters,
as described below.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/kernel/acct</I>

<DD>
This file
contains three numbers:
<I>highwater</I>,

<I>lowwater</I>,

and
<I>frequency</I>.

If BSD-style process accounting is enabled these values control
its behavior.
If free space on file system where the log lives goes below
<I>lowwater</I>

percent accounting suspends.
If free space gets above
<I>highwater</I>

percent accounting resumes.
<I>frequency</I>

determines
how often the kernel checks the amount of free space (value is in
seconds).
Default values are 4, 2 and 30.
That is, suspend accounting if 2% or less space is free; resume it
if 4% or more space is free; consider information about amount of free space
valid for 30 seconds.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/kernel/cap-bound</I> (from Linux 2.2 to 2.6.24)

<DD>
This file holds the value of the kernel
<I>capability bounding set</I>

(expressed as a signed decimal number).
This set is ANDed against the capabilities permitted to a process
during
<B><A HREF="../man2/execve.2.html">execve</A></B>(2).

Starting with Linux 2.6.25,
the system-wide capability bounding set disappeared,
and was replaced by a per-thread bounding set; see
<B><A HREF="../man7/capabilities.7.html">capabilities</A></B>(7).

<DT><I>/proc/sys/kernel/ctrl-alt-del</I>

<DD>
This file
controls the handling of Ctrl-Alt-Del from the keyboard.
When the value in this file is 0, Ctrl-Alt-Del is trapped and
sent to the
<B><A HREF="../man8/init.8.html">init</A></B>(8)

program to handle a graceful restart.
When the value is greater than zero, Linux's reaction to a Vulcan
Nerve Pinch (tm) will be an immediate reboot, without even
syncing its dirty buffers.
Note: when a program (like dosemu) has the keyboard in &quot;raw&quot;
mode, the ctrl-alt-del is intercepted by the program before it
ever reaches the kernel tty layer, and it's up to the program
to decide what to do with it.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/kernel/hotplug</I>

<DD>
This file
contains the path for the hotplug policy agent.
The default value in this file is
<I>/sbin/hotplug</I>.

<DT><I>/proc/sys/kernel/domainname</I> and <I>/proc/sys/kernel/hostname</I>

<DD>
can be used to set the NIS/YP domainname and the
hostname of your box in exactly the same way as the commands
<B><A HREF="../man1/domainname.1.html">domainname</A></B>(1)

and
<B><A HREF="../man1/hostname.1.html">hostname</A></B>(1),

that is:
<P>

<PRE>
#<B> echo 'darkstar' &gt; /proc/sys/kernel/hostname</B>
#<B> echo 'mydomain' &gt; /proc/sys/kernel/domainname</B>
</PRE>


<P>
has the same effect as
<P>

<PRE>
#<B> hostname 'darkstar'</B>
#<B> domainname 'mydomain'</B>
</PRE>


<P>
Note, however, that the classic darkstar.frop.org has the
hostname &quot;darkstar&quot; and DNS (Internet Domain Name Server)
domainname &quot;frop.org&quot;, not to be confused with the NIS (Network
Information Service) or YP (Yellow Pages) domainname.
These two
domain names are in general different.
For a detailed discussion
see the
<B><A HREF="../man1/hostname.1.html">hostname</A></B>(1)

man page.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/kernel/htab-reclaim</I>

<DD>
(PowerPC only) If this file is set to a nonzero value,
the PowerPC htab
(see kernel file
<I>Documentation/powerpc/ppc_htab.txt</I>)

is pruned
each time the system hits the idle loop.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/kernel/l2cr</I>

<DD>
(PowerPC only) This file
contains a flag that controls the L2 cache of G3 processor
boards.
If 0, the cache is disabled.
Enabled if nonzero.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/kernel/modprobe</I>

<DD>
This file contains the path for the kernel module loader.
The default value is
<I>/sbin/modprobe</I>.

The file is only present if the kernel is built with the
<B>CONFIG_KMOD</B>

option enabled.
It is described by the kernel source file
<I>Documentation/kmod.txt</I>

(only present in kernel 2.4 and earlier).
<DT><I>/proc/sys/kernel/msgmax</I>

<DD>
This file defines
a system-wide limit specifying the maximum number of bytes in
a single message written on a System V message queue.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/kernel/msgmni</I>

<DD>
This file defines the system-wide limit on the number of
message queue identifiers.
(This file is only present in Linux 2.4 onward.)
<DT><I>/proc/sys/kernel/msgmnb</I>

<DD>
This file defines a system-wide parameter used to initialize the
<I>msg_qbytes</I>

setting for subsequently created message queues.
The
<I>msg_qbytes</I>

setting specifies the maximum number of bytes that may be written to the
message queue.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/kernel/ostype</I> and <I>/proc/sys/kernel/osrelease</I>

<DD>
These files
give substrings of
<I>/proc/version</I>.

<DT><I>/proc/sys/kernel/overflowgid</I> and <I>/proc/sys/kernel/overflowuid</I>

<DD>
These files duplicate the files
<I>/proc/sys/fs/overflowgid</I>

and
<I>/proc/sys/fs/overflowuid</I>.

<DT><I>/proc/sys/kernel/panic</I>

<DD>
This file gives read/write access to the kernel variable
<I>panic_timeout</I>.

If this is zero, the kernel will loop on a panic; if nonzero
it indicates that the kernel should autoreboot after this number
of seconds.
When you use the
software watchdog device driver, the recommended setting is 60.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/kernel/panic_on_oops</I> (since Linux 2.5.68)

<DD>
This file controls the kernel's behavior when an oops
or BUG is encountered.
If this file contains 0, then the system
tries to continue operation.
If it contains 1, then the system
delays a few seconds (to give klogd time to record the oops output)
and then panics.
If the
<I>/proc/sys/kernel/panic</I>

file is also nonzero then the machine will be rebooted.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/kernel/pid_max</I> (since Linux 2.5.34)

<DD>
This file specifies the value at which PIDs wrap around
(i.e., the value in this file is one greater than the maximum PID).
The default value for this file, 32768,
results in the same range of PIDs as on earlier kernels.
On 32-bit platforms, 32768 is the maximum value for
<I>pid_max</I>.

On 64-bit systems,
<I>pid_max</I>

can be set to any value up to 2^22
(<B>PID_MAX_LIMIT</B>,

approximately 4 million).



<DT><I>/proc/sys/kernel/powersave-nap</I> (PowerPC only)

<DD>
This file contains a flag.
If set, Linux-PPC will use the &quot;nap&quot; mode of
powersaving,
otherwise the &quot;doze&quot; mode will be used.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/kernel/printk</I>

<DD>
The four values in this file are
<I>console_loglevel</I>,

<I>default_message_loglevel</I>,

<I>minimum_console_level</I>,

and
<I>default_console_loglevel</I>.

These values influence
<I>printk()</I>

behavior when printing or logging error messages.
See
<B><A HREF="../man2/syslog.2.html">syslog</A></B>(2)

for more info on the different loglevels.
Messages with a higher priority than
<I>console_loglevel</I>

will be printed to the console.
Messages without an explicit priority will be printed with priority
<I>default_message_level</I>.

<I>minimum_console_loglevel</I>

is the minimum (highest) value to which
<I>console_loglevel</I>

can be set.
<I>default_console_loglevel</I>

is the default value for
<I>console_loglevel</I>.

<DT><I>/proc/sys/kernel/pty</I> (since Linux 2.6.4)

<DD>
This directory contains two files relating to the number of UNIX 98
pseudoterminals (see
<B><A HREF="../man4/pts.4.html">pts</A></B>(4))

on the system.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/kernel/pty/max</I>

<DD>
This file defines the maximum number of pseudoterminals.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/kernel/pty/nr</I>

<DD>
This read-only file
indicates how many pseudoterminals are currently in use.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/kernel/random</I>

<DD>
This directory
contains various parameters controlling the operation of the file
<I>/dev/random</I>.

See
<B><A HREF="../man4/random.4.html">random</A></B>(4)

for further information.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/kernel/real-root-dev</I>

<DD>
This file is documented in the kernel source file
<I>Documentation/initrd.txt</I>.

<DT><I>/proc/sys/kernel/reboot-cmd</I> (Sparc only) 

<DD>
This file seems to be a way to give an argument to the SPARC
ROM/Flash boot loader.
Maybe to tell it what to do after
rebooting?
<DT><I>/proc/sys/kernel/rtsig-max</I>

<DD>
(Only in kernels up to and including 2.6.7; see
<B><A HREF="../man2/setrlimit.2.html">setrlimit</A></B>(2))

This file can be used to tune the maximum number
of POSIX real-time (queued) signals that can be outstanding
in the system.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/kernel/rtsig-nr</I>

<DD>
(Only in kernels up to and including 2.6.7.)
This file shows the number POSIX real-time signals currently queued.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/kernel/sem</I> (since Linux 2.4)

<DD>
This file contains 4 numbers defining limits for System V IPC semaphores.
These fields are, in order:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>SEMMSL<DD>
The maximum semaphores per semaphore set.
<DT>SEMMNS<DD>
A system-wide limit on the number of semaphores in all semaphore sets.
<DT>SEMOPM<DD>
The maximum number of operations that may be specified in a
<B><A HREF="../man2/semop.2.html">semop</A></B>(2)

call.
<DT>SEMMNI<DD>
A system-wide limit on the maximum number of semaphore identifiers.
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><I>/proc/sys/kernel/sg-big-buff</I>

<DD>
This file
shows the size of the generic SCSI device (sg) buffer.
You can't tune it just yet, but you could change it at
compile time by editing
<I>include/scsi/sg.h</I>

and changing
the value of
<B>SG_BIG_BUFF</B>.

However, there shouldn't be any reason to change this value.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/kernel/shmall</I>

<DD>
This file
contains the system-wide limit on the total number of pages of
System V shared memory.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/kernel/shmmax</I>

<DD>
This file
can be used to query and set the run-time limit
on the maximum (System V IPC) shared memory segment size that can be
created.
Shared memory segments up to 1GB are now supported in the
kernel.
This value defaults to
<B>SHMMAX</B>.

<DT><I>/proc/sys/kernel/shmmni</I>

<DD>
(available in Linux 2.4 and onward)
This file
specifies the system-wide maximum number of System V shared memory
segments that can be created.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/kernel/sysrq</I>

<DD>
This file controls the functions allowed to be invoked by the SysRq key.
By default,
the file contains 1 meaning that every possible SysRq request is allowed
(in older kernel versions, SysRq was disabled by default,
and you were required to specifically enable it at run-time,
but this is not the case any more).
Possible values in this file are:
<P>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0&nbsp;-&nbsp;disable&nbsp;sysrq&nbsp;completely
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;-&nbsp;enable&nbsp;all&nbsp;functions&nbsp;of&nbsp;sysrq

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;256&nbsp;-&nbsp;allow&nbsp;nicing&nbsp;of&nbsp;all&nbsp;real-time&nbsp;tasks
<P>
This file is only present if the
<B>CONFIG_MAGIC_SYSRQ</B>

kernel configuration option is enabled.
For further details see the kernel source file
<I>Documentation/sysrq.txt</I>.

<DT><I>/proc/sys/kernel/version</I>

<DD>
This file contains a string like:
<P>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#5&nbsp;Wed&nbsp;Feb&nbsp;25&nbsp;21:49:24&nbsp;MET&nbsp;1998
<P>
The &quot;#5&quot; means that
this is the fifth kernel built from this source base and the
date behind it indicates the time the kernel was built.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/kernel/threads-max</I> (since Linux 2.3.11)

<DD>
This file specifies the system-wide limit on the number of
threads (tasks) that can be created on the system.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/kernel/zero-paged</I> (PowerPC only) 

<DD>
This file
contains a flag.
When enabled (nonzero), Linux-PPC will pre-zero pages in
the idle loop, possibly speeding up get_free_pages.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/net</I>

<DD>
This directory contains networking stuff.
Explanations for some of the files under this directory can be found in
<B><A HREF="../man7/tcp.7.html">tcp</A></B>(7)

and
<B><A HREF="../man7/ip.7.html">ip</A></B>(7).

<DT><I>/proc/sys/net/core/somaxconn</I>

<DD>
This file defines a ceiling value for the
<I>backlog</I>

argument of
<B><A HREF="../man2/listen.2.html">listen</A></B>(2);

see the
<B><A HREF="../man2/listen.2.html">listen</A></B>(2)

manual page for details.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/proc</I>

<DD>
This directory may be empty.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/sunrpc</I>

<DD>
This directory supports Sun remote procedure call for network file system
(NFS).
On some systems, it is not present.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/vm</I>

<DD>
This directory contains files for memory management tuning, buffer and
cache management.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/vm/drop_caches</I> (since Linux 2.6.16)

<DD>
Writing to this file causes the kernel to drop clean caches, dentries and
inodes from memory, causing that memory to become free.
<P>
To free pagecache, use
<I>echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches</I>;

to free dentries and inodes, use
<I>echo 2 &gt; /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches</I>;

to free pagecache, dentries and inodes, use
<I>echo 3 &gt; /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches</I>.

<P>
Because this is a nondestructive operation and dirty objects
are not freeable, the
user should run
<B><A HREF="../man8/sync.8.html">sync</A></B>(8)

first.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/vm/legacy_va_layout</I> (since Linux 2.6.9)

<DD>

If nonzero, this disables the new 32-bit memory-mapping layout;
the kernel will use the legacy (2.4) layout for all processes.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/vm/memory_failure_early_kill</I> (since Linux 2.6.32)

<DD>

Control how to kill processes when an uncorrected memory error
(typically a 2-bit error in a memory module)
that cannot be handled by the kernel
is detected in the background by hardware.
In some cases (like the page still having a valid copy on disk),
the kernel will handle the failure
transparently without affecting any applications.
But if there is no other up-to-date copy of the data,
it will kill processes to prevent any data corruptions from propagating.
<P>
The file has one of the following values:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>1:<DD>
Kill all processes that have the corrupted-and-not-reloadable page mapped
as soon as the corruption is detected.
Note this is not supported for a few types of pages, like kernel internally
allocated data or the swap cache, but works for the majority of user pages.
<DT>0:<DD>
Only unmap the corrupted page from all processes and only kill a process
who tries to access it.
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
The kill is performed using a
<B>SIGBUS</B>

signal with
<I>si_code</I>

set to
<B>BUS_MCEERR_AO</B>.

Processes can handle this if they want to; see
<B><A HREF="../man2/sigaction.2.html">sigaction</A></B>(2)

for more details.
<P>
This feature is only active on architectures/platforms with advanced machine
check handling and depends on the hardware capabilities.
<P>
Applications can override the
<I>memory_failure_early_kill</I>

setting individually with the
<B><A HREF="../man2/prctl.2.html">prctl</A></B>(2)

<B>PR_MCE_KILL</B>

operation.
<DT><DD>
Only present if the kernel was configured with
<B>CONFIG_MEMORY_FAILURE</B>.

<DT><I>/proc/sys/vm/memory_failure_recovery</I> (since Linux 2.6.32)

<DD>

Enable memory failure recovery (when supported by the platform)
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>1:<DD>
Attempt recovery.
<DT>0:<DD>
Always panic on a memory failure.
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
Only present if the kernel was configured with
<B>CONFIG_MEMORY_FAILURE</B>.

<DT><I>/proc/sys/vm/oom_dump_tasks</I> (since Linux 2.6.25)

<DD>

Enables a system-wide task dump (excluding kernel threads) to be
produced when the kernel performs an OOM-killing.
The dump includes the following information
for each task (thread, process):
thread ID, real user ID, thread group ID (process ID),
virtual memory size, resident set size,
the CPU that the task is scheduled on,
oom_adj score (see the description of
<I>/proc/[pid]/oom_adj</I>),

and command name.
This is helpful to determine why the OOM-killer was invoked
and to identify the rogue task that caused it.
<P>
If this contains the value zero, this information is suppressed.
On very large systems with thousands of tasks,
it may not be feasible to dump the memory state information for each one.
Such systems should not be forced to incur a performance penalty in
OOM situations when the information may not be desired.
<P>
If this is set to nonzero, this information is shown whenever the
OOM-killer actually kills a memory-hogging task.
<P>
The default value is 0.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/vm/oom_kill_allocating_task</I> (since Linux 2.6.24)

<DD>

This enables or disables killing the OOM-triggering task in
out-of-memory situations.
<P>
If this is set to zero, the OOM-killer will scan through the entire
tasklist and select a task based on heuristics to kill.
This normally selects a rogue memory-hogging task that
frees up a large amount of memory when killed.
<P>
If this is set to nonzero, the OOM-killer simply kills the task that
triggered the out-of-memory condition.
This avoids a possibly expensive tasklist scan.
<P>
If
<I>/proc/sys/vm/panic_on_oom</I>

is nonzero, it takes precedence over whatever value is used in
<I>/proc/sys/vm/oom_kill_allocating_task</I>.

<P>
The default value is 0.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory</I>

<DD>
This file contains the kernel virtual memory accounting mode.
Values are:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
0: heuristic overcommit (this is the default)
<BR>

1: always overcommit, never check
<BR>

2: always check, never overcommit
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
In mode 0, calls of
<B><A HREF="../man2/mmap.2.html">mmap</A></B>(2)

with
<B>MAP_NORESERVE</B>

are not checked, and the default check is very weak,
leading to the risk of getting a process &quot;OOM-killed&quot;.
Under Linux 2.4 any nonzero value implies mode 1.
In mode 2 (available since Linux 2.6), the total virtual address space
on the system is limited to (SS + RAM*(r/100)),
where SS is the size of the swap space, and RAM
is the size of the physical memory, and r is the contents of the file
<I>/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_ratio</I>.

<DT><I>/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_ratio</I>

<DD>
See the description of
<I>/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory</I>.

<DT><I>/proc/sys/vm/panic_on_oom</I> (since Linux 2.6.18)

<DD>

This enables or disables a kernel panic in
an out-of-memory situation.
<P>
If this file is set to the value 0,
the kernel's OOM-killer will kill some rogue process.
Usually, the OOM-killer is able to kill a rogue process and the
system will survive.
<P>
If this file is set to the value 1,
then the kernel normally panics when out-of-memory happens.
However, if a process limits allocations to certain nodes
using memory policies
(<B><A HREF="../man2/mbind.2.html">mbind</A></B>(2)

<B>MPOL_BIND</B>)

or cpusets
(<B><A HREF="../man7/cpuset.7.html">cpuset</A></B>(7))

and those nodes reach memory exhaustion status,
one process may be killed by the OOM-killer.
No panic occurs in this case:
because other nodes' memory may be free,
this means the system as a whole may not have reached
an out-of-memory situation yet.
<P>
If this file is set to the value 2,
the kernel always panics when an out-of-memory condition occurs.
<P>
The default value is 0.
1 and 2 are for failover of clustering.
Select either according to your policy of failover.
<DT><I>/proc/sys/vm/swappiness</I>

<DD>

The value in this file controls how aggressively the kernel will swap
memory pages.
Higher values increase aggressiveness, lower values
decrease aggressiveness.
The default value is 60.
<DT><I>/proc/sysrq-trigger</I> (since Linux 2.4.21)

<DD>
Writing a character to this file triggers the same SysRq function as
typing ALT-SysRq-&lt;character&gt; (see the description of
<I>/proc/sys/kernel/sysrq</I>).

This file is normally only writable by
<I>root</I>.

For further details see the kernel source file
<I>Documentation/sysrq.txt</I>.

<DT><I>/proc/sysvipc</I>

<DD>
Subdirectory containing the pseudo-files
<I>msg</I>, <I>sem</I> and <I>shm</I>.

These files list the System V Interprocess Communication (IPC) objects
(respectively: message queues, semaphores, and shared memory)
that currently exist on the system,
providing similar information to that available via
<B><A HREF="../man1/ipcs.1.html">ipcs</A></B>(1).

These files have headers and are formatted (one IPC object per line)
for easy understanding.
<B><A HREF="../man7/svipc.7.html">svipc</A></B>(7)

provides further background on the information shown by these files.
<DT><I>/proc/tty</I>

<DD>
Subdirectory containing the pseudo-files and subdirectories for
tty drivers and line disciplines.
<DT><I>/proc/uptime</I>

<DD>
This file contains two numbers: the uptime of the system (seconds),
and the amount of time spent in idle process (seconds).
<DT><I>/proc/version</I>

<DD>
This string identifies the kernel version that is currently running.
It includes the contents of
<I>/proc/sys/kernel/ostype</I>,

<I>/proc/sys/kernel/osrelease</I>

and
<I>/proc/sys/kernel/version</I>.

For example:
<PRE>

<H2>NOTES</H2>

Many strings (i.e., the environment and command line) are in
the internal format, with subfields terminated by null bytes ('\0'),
so you
may find that things are more readable if you use <I>od -c</I> or <I>tr
&quot;\000&quot; &quot;\n&quot;</I> to read them.
Alternatively, <I>echo `cat &lt;file&gt;`</I> works well.
