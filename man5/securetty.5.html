securetty - file which lists terminals from which root can log in
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The file
<I>/etc/securetty</I>

contains the names of terminals
(one per line, without leading
<I>/dev/</I>)

which are considered secure for the transmission of certain authentication
tokens.
<P>

It is used by (some versions of)
<B><A HREF="../man1/login.1.html">login</A></B>(1)

to restrict the terminals
on which root is allowed to login.
See
<B><A HREF="../man5/login.defs.5.html">login.defs</A></B>(5)

if you use the shadow suite.
<P>

On PAM enabled systems, it is used for the same purpose by
<B><A HREF="../man8/pam_securetty.8.html">pam_securetty</A></B>(8)

to restrict the terminals on which empty passwords are accepted.
