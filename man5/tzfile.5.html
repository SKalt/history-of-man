<H2>NAME</H2>

tzfile - timezone information
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

This page describes the structure of the timezone files used by
<B><A HREF="../man3/tzset.3.html">tzset</A></B>(3).

These files are typically found under one of the directories
<I>/usr/lib/zoneinfo</I>

or
<I>/usr/share/zoneinfo</I>.

<P>
Timezone information files
begin with the magic characters &quot;TZif&quot; to identify them as
timezone information files,
followed by a character identifying the version of the file's format
(as of 2005, either an ASCII NUL ('\0') or a '2')
followed by fifteen bytes containing zeros reserved for future use,
followed by six four-byte values of type
<I>long</I>,

written in a &quot;standard&quot; byte order
(the high-order byte of the value is written first).
These values are,
in order:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><I>tzh_ttisgmtcnt</I>

<DD>
The number of UTC/local indicators stored in the file.
<DT><I>tzh_ttisstdcnt</I>

<DD>
The number of standard/wall indicators stored in the file.
<DT><I>tzh_leapcnt</I>

<DD>
The number of leap seconds for which data is stored in the file.
<DT><I>tzh_timecnt</I>

<DD>
The number of &quot;transition times&quot; for which data is stored
in the file.
<DT><I>tzh_typecnt</I>

<DD>
The number of &quot;local time types&quot; for which data is stored
in the file (must not be zero).
<DT><I>tzh_charcnt</I>

<DD>
The number of characters of &quot;timezone abbreviation strings&quot;
stored in the file.
</DL>
<P>

The above header is followed by
<I>tzh_timecnt</I>

four-byte values of type
<I>long</I>,

sorted in ascending order.
These values are written in &quot;standard&quot; byte order.
Each is used as a transition time (as returned by
<B><A HREF="../man2/time.2.html">time</A></B>(2))

at which the rules for computing local time change.
Next come
<I>tzh_timecnt</I>

one-byte values of type
<I>unsigned char</I>;

each one tells which of the different types of &quot;local time&quot; types
described in the file is associated with the same-indexed transition time.
These values serve as indices into an array of
<I>ttinfo</I>

structures (with
<I>tzh_typecnt</I>

entries) that appear next in the file;
these structures are defined as follows:

<P>
<PRE>
struct ttinfo {
    long         tt_gmtoff;
    int          tt_isdst;
    unsigned int tt_abbrind;
};
</PRE>

<P>
Each structure is written as a four-byte value for
<I>tt_gmtoff</I>

of type
<I>long</I>,

in a standard byte order, followed by a one-byte value for
<I>tt_isdst</I>

and a one-byte value for
<I>tt_abbrind</I>.

In each structure,
<I>tt_gmtoff</I>

gives the number of seconds to be added to UTC,
<I>tt_isdst</I>

tells whether
<I>tm_isdst</I>

should be set by
<B><A HREF="../man3/localtime.3.html">localtime</A></B>(3),

and
<I>tt_abbrind</I>

serves as an index into the array of timezone abbreviation characters
that follow the
<I>ttinfo</I>

structure(s) in the file.
<P>

Then there are
<I>tzh_leapcnt</I>

pairs of four-byte values, written in standard byte order;
the first value of each pair gives the time
(as returned by
<B><A HREF="../man2/time.2.html">time</A></B>(2))

at which a leap second occurs;
the second gives the
<I>total</I>

number of leap seconds to be applied after the given time.
The pairs of values are sorted in ascending order by time.
<P>

Then there are
<I>tzh_ttisstdcnt</I>

standard/wall indicators, each stored as a one-byte value;
they tell whether the transition times associated with local time types
were specified as standard time or wall clock time,
and are used when a timezone file is used in handling POSIX-style
timezone environment variables.
<P>

Finally, there are
<I>tzh_ttisgmtcnt</I>

UTC/local indicators, each stored as a one-byte value;
they tell whether the transition times associated with local time types
were specified as UTC or local time,
and are used when a timezone file is used in handling POSIX-style
timezone environment variables.
<P>

<B><A HREF="../man3/localtime.3.html">localtime</A></B>(3)

uses the first standard-time
<I>ttinfo</I>

structure in the file
(or simply the first
<I>ttinfo</I>

structure in the absence of a standard-time structure)
if either
<I>tzh_timecnt</I>

is zero or the time argument is less than the first transition time recorded
in the file.
<P>

For version-2-format timezone files,
the above header and data is followed by a second header and data,
identical in format except that
eight bytes are used for each transition time or leap-second time.
After the second header and data comes a newline-enclosed,
POSIX-TZ-environment-variable-style string for use in handling instants
after the last transition time stored in the file
(with nothing between the newlines if there is no POSIX representation for
such instants).
