<H2>NAME</H2>

arp - Linux ARP kernel module. 
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

This kernel protocol module implements the Address Resolution
Protocol defined in RFC&nbsp;826.
It is used to convert between Layer2 hardware addresses
and IPv4 protocol addresses on directly connected networks. 
The user normally doesn't interact directly with this module except to 
configure it; 
instead it provides a service for other protocols in the kernel.
<P>
A user process can receive ARP packets by using
<B><A HREF="../man7/packet.7.html">packet</A></B>(7)

sockets.  There is also a mechanism for managing the ARP cache
in user-space by using
<B><A HREF="../man7/netlink.7.html">netlink</A></B>(7)

sockets. The ARP table can also be controlled via 
<B><A HREF="../man2/ioctl.2.html">ioctl</A></B>(2)

on any 
<B>PF_INET </B>

socket.
<P>
The ARP module maintains a cache of mappings between hardware addresses
and protocol addresses.  The cache has a limited size so old and less
frequently used entries are garbage-collected.  Entries which are marked
as permanent are never deleted by the garbage-collector.  The cache can
be directly manipulated by the use of ioctls and its behaviour can be
tuned by the sysctls defined below.  
<P>
When there is no positive feedback for an existing mapping after some
time (see the sysctls below) a neighbour cache entry is considered stale.
Positive feedback can be gotten from a higher layer; for example from
a successful TCP ACK. Other protocols can signal forward progress
using the
<B>MSG_CONFIRM</B>

flag to
<B><A HREF="../man2/sendmsg.2.html">sendmsg</A></B>(2).

When there is no forward progress ARP tries to reprobe.
It first tries to ask a local arp daemon
<B>app_solicit </B>

times for an updated MAC address.
If that fails and an old MAC address is known an unicast probe is send
<B>ucast_solicit</B>

times. If that fails too it will broadcast a new ARP 
request to the network. Requests are only send when there is data queued
for sending. 
<P>
Linux will automatically add a non-permanent proxy arp entry when it 
receives a request for an address it forwards to and proxy arp is 
enabled on the receiving interface. 
When there is a reject route for the target no proxy arp entry is added.
<P>
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>IOCTLS</H2>

Three ioctls are available on all 
<B>PF_INET</B>

sockets.
They take a pointer to a
<I>struct arpreq</I>

as their parameter.
<P>
<PRE>

struct arpreq {
    struct sockaddr arp_pa;      /* protocol address */
    struct sockaddr arp_ha;      /* hardware address */
    int             arp_flags;   /* flags */
    struct sockaddr arp_netmask; /* netmask of protocol address */
    char            arp_dev[16];
};
</PRE>

<P>
<B>SIOCSARP</B>, <B>SIOCDARP</B> and <B>SIOCGARP</B>

respectively set, delete and get an ARP mapping.
Setting &amp; deleting ARP maps are privileged operations and may
only be performed by a process with the
<B>CAP_NET_ADMIN</B>

capability or an effective UID of 0.
<P>
<I>arp_pa</I>

must be an
<B>AF_INET</B>

socket and
<I>arp_ha</I>

must have the same type as the device which is specified in
<I>arp_dev</I>.

<I>arp_dev</I>

is a zero-terminated string which names a device.

<P>
If the
<B>ATF_NETMASK</B>

flag is set, then
<I>arp_netmask</I>

should be valid.  
Linux 2.2 does not support proxy network ARP entries, so this
should be set to 0xffffffff, or 0 to remove an existing proxy arp entry. 
<B>ATF_USETRAILERS</B>

is obsolete and should not be used.
<P>
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYSCTLS</H2>

ARP supports a sysctl interface to configure parameters on a global
or per-interface basis.
The sysctls can be accessed by reading or writing the 
<I>/proc/sys/net/ipv4/neigh/*/*</I>

files or with the 
<B><A HREF="../man2/sysctl.2.html">sysctl</A></B>(2)

interface.  Each interface in the system has its own directory in
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/neigh/.
The setting in the `default' directory is used for all newly created 
devices.
Unless otherwise specified time related sysctls are specified 
in seconds.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>anycast_delay</B>

<DD>
The maximum number of jiffies to delay before replying to a
IPv6 neighbour solicitation message.
Anycast support is not yet implemented.
Defaults to 1 second.
<DT><B>app_solicit</B>

<DD>
The maximum number of probes to send to the user space ARP daemon via
netlink before dropping back to multicast probes (see
<I>mcast_solicit</I>).

Defaults to 0.
<DT><B>base_reachable_time</B>

<DD>
Once a neighbour has been found, the entry is considered to be valid
for at least a random value between
<I>base_reachable_time</I>/2 and 3*<I>base_reachable_time</I>/2.

An entry's validity will be extended if it receives positive feedback
from higher level protocols.
Defaults to 30 seconds.
<DT><B>delay_first_probe_time</B>

<DD>
Delay before first probe after it has been decided that a neighbour
is stale. 
Defaults to 5 seconds.
<DT><B>gc_interval</B>

<DD>
How frequently the garbage collector for neighbour entries 
should attempt to run.
Defaults to 30 seconds.
<DT><B>gc_stale_time</B>

<DD>
Determines how often to check for stale neighbour entries.  When 
a neighbour entry is considered stale it is resolved again before 
sending data to it. 
Defaults to 60 seconds.
<DT><B>gc_thresh1</B>

<DD>
The minimum number of entries to keep in the ARP cache.
The garbage collector will not run if there are fewer than
this number of entries in the cache.
Defaults to 128.
<DT><B>gc_thresh2</B>

<DD>
The soft maximum number of entries to keep in the ARP cache.
The garbage collector will allow the number of entries to exceed
this for 5 seconds before collection will be performed.
Defaults to 512.
<DT><B>gc_thresh3</B>

<DD>
The hard maximum number of entries to keep in the ARP cache.
The garbage collector will always run if there are more than
this number of entries in the cache.
Defaults to 1024.
<DT><B>locktime</B>

<DD>
The minimum number of jiffies to keep an ARP entry in the cache.
This prevents ARP cache thrashing if there is more than one potential
mapping (generally due to network misconfiguration).
Defaults to 1 second.
<DT><B>mcast_solicit</B>

<DD>
The maximum number of attempts to resolve an address by 
multicast/broadcast before marking the entry as unreachable.
Defaults to 3.
<DT><B>proxy_delay</B>

<DD>
When an ARP request for a known proxy-ARP address is received, delay up to
<I>proxy_delay</I>

jiffies before replying.
This is used to prevent network flooding in some cases.
Defaults to 0.8 seconds.
<DT><B>proxy_qlen</B>

<DD>
The maximum number of packets which may be queued to proxy-ARP addresses.
Defaults to 64.
<DT><B>retrans_time</B>

<DD>
The number of jiffies to delay before retransmitting a request.
Defaults to 1 second.
<DT><B>ucast_solicit</B>

<DD>
The maximum number of attempts to send unicast probes before asking
the ARP daemon (see
<I>app_solicit</I>).

Defaults to 3.
<DT><B>unres_qlen</B>

<DD>
The maximum number of packets which may be queued for each unresolved
address by other network layers.
Defaults to 3.

<H2>BUGS</H2>

Some timer settings are specified in jiffies, which is architecture 
related.
On the Alpha a jiffy is 1/1024 of a second, on most other 
architectures it is 1/100s.
<P>
There is no way to signal positive feedback from user space. 
This means connection oriented protocols implemented in user space 
will generate excessive ARP traffic, because ndisc will regularly 
reprobe the MAC address.
The same problem applies for some kernel protocols (e.g. NFS over UDP).
<P>
This man page mashes IPv4 specific and shared between IPv4 and IPv6 
functionality together.
<P>
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>VERSIONS</H2>

The
<I>struct arpreq</I>

changed in Linux 2.0 to include the
<I>arp_dev</I>

member and the ioctl numbers changed at the same time.
Support for the old ioctls was dropped in Linux 2.2.
<P>
Support for proxy arp entries for networks (netmask not equal 0xffffffff) 
was dropped in Linux 2.2. It is replaced by automatic proxy arp setup by
the kernel for all reachable hosts on other interfaces (when 
forwarding and proxy arp is enabled for the interface).
<P>
The neigh/* sysctls did not exist before Linux 2.2.
