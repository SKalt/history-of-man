<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

Linux implements the Appletalk protocols described in
<I>Inside Appletalk</I>.

Only the DDP layer and AARP are present in
the kernel.
They are designed to be used via the
<B>netatalk</B>

protocol
libraries.
This page documents the interface for those who wish or need to
use the DDP layer directly.
<P>

The communication between Appletalk and the user program works using a
BSD-compatible socket interface.
For more information on sockets, see
<B><A HREF="../man7/socket.7.html">socket</A></B>(7).

<P>

An AppleTalk socket is created by calling the
<B><A HREF="../man2/socket.2.html">socket</A></B>(2)

function with a
<B>AF_APPLETALK</B>

socket family argument.
Valid socket types are
<B>SOCK_DGRAM</B>

to open a
<B>ddp</B>

socket or
<B>SOCK_RAW</B>

to open a
<B>raw</B>

socket.
<I>protocol</I>

is the Appletalk protocol to be received or sent.
For
<B>SOCK_RAW</B>

you must specify
<B>ATPROTO_DDP</B>.

<P>

Raw sockets may be only opened by a process with effective user ID 0
or when the process has the
<B>CAP_NET_RAW</B>

capability.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Address Format</H3>

An Appletalk socket address is defined as a combination of a network number,
a node number, and a port number.
<P>


<PRE>
struct at_addr {
    unsigned short s_net;
    unsigned char  s_node;
};

struct sockaddr_atalk {
    sa_family_t    sat_family;    /* address family */
    unsigned char  sat_port;      /* port */
    struct at_addr sat_addr;      /* net/node */
};
</PRE>


<P>

<I>sat_family</I>

is always set to
<B>AF_APPLETALK</B>.

<I>sat_port</I>

contains the port.
The port numbers below 129 are known as
<I>reserved ports</I>.

Only processes with the effective user ID 0 or the
<B>CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE</B>

capability may
<B><A HREF="../man2/bind.2.html">bind</A></B>(2)

to these sockets.
<I>sat_addr</I>

is the host address.
The
<I>net</I>

member of
<I>struct at_addr</I>

contains the host network in network byte order.
The value of
<B>AT_ANYNET</B>

is a
wildcard and also implies "this network."
The
<I>node</I>

member of
<I>struct at_addr</I>

contains the host node number.
The value of
<B>AT_ANYNODE</B>

is a
wildcard and also implies "this node." The value of
<B>ATADDR_BCAST</B>

is a link
local broadcast address.

<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Socket Options</H3>

No protocol-specific socket options are supported.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>/proc interfaces</H3>

IP supports a set of
<I>/proc</I>

interfaces to configure some global AppleTalk parameters.
The parameters can be accessed by reading or writing files in the directory
<I>/proc/sys/net/atalk/</I>.

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><I>aarp-expiry-time</I>

<DD>
The time interval (in seconds) before an AARP cache entry expires.
<DT><I>aarp-resolve-time</I>

<DD>
The time interval (in seconds) before an AARP cache entry is resolved.
<DT><I>aarp-retransmit-limit</I>

<DD>
The number of retransmissions of an AARP query before the node is declared
dead.
<DT><I>aarp-tick-time</I>

<DD>
The timer rate (in seconds) for the timer driving AARP.
</DL>
<P>

The default values match the specification and should never need to be
changed.
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Ioctls</H3>

All ioctls described in
<B><A HREF="../man7/socket.7.html">socket</A></B>(7)

apply to DDP.

<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>




<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EACCES</B>

<DD>
The user tried to execute an operation without the necessary permissions.
These include sending to a broadcast address without
having the broadcast flag set,
and trying to bind to a reserved port without effective user ID 0 or
<B>CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE</B>.

<DT><B>EADDRINUSE</B>

<DD>
Tried to bind to an address already in use.
<DT><B>EADDRNOTAVAIL</B>

<DD>
A nonexistent interface was requested or the requested source address was
not local.
<DT><B>EAGAIN</B>

<DD>
Operation on a nonblocking socket would block.
<DT><B>EALREADY</B>

<DD>
A connection operation on a nonblocking socket is already in progress.
<DT><B>ECONNABORTED</B>

or send signals to the requested process or group,
<DT><B>EPIPE</B>

<DT><B>ESOCKTNOSUPPORT</B>

<H2>VERSIONS</H2>

Appletalk is supported by Linux 2.0 or higher.
The
<I>/proc</I>

interfaces exist since Linux 2.2.
<A NAME="lbAK">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NOTES</H2>

Be very careful with the
<B>SO_BROADCAST</B>

option - it is not privileged in Linux.
It is easy to overload the network
with careless sending to broadcast addresses.
<A NAME="lbAL">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Compatibility</H3>

The basic AppleTalk socket interface is compatible with
<B>netatalk</B>

on BSD-derived systems.
Many BSD systems fail to check
<B>SO_BROADCAST</B>

when sending broadcast frames; this can lead to compatibility problems.
<P>

The
raw
socket mode is unique to Linux and exists to support the alternative CAP
package and AppleTalk monitoring tools more easily.
<A NAME="lbAM">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>BUGS</H2>

There are too many inconsistent error values.
<P>

The ioctls used to configure routing tables, devices,
AARP tables and other devices are not yet described.
