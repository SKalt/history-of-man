<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

Linux implements the Internet Protocol, version 4,
described in RFC&nbsp;791 and RFC&nbsp;1122.
<B>ip</B>

contains a level 2
multicasting implementation conforming to RFC&nbsp;1112.
It also contains an IP router including a packet filter.

<P>

The programming interface is BSD sockets compatible.
For more information on sockets, see
<B><A HREF="../man7/socket.7.html">socket</A></B>(7).

<P>

An IP socket is created by calling the
<B><A HREF="../man2/socket.2.html">socket</A></B>(2)

function as
<B>socket(PF_INET, socket_type, protocol)</B>.

Valid socket types are
<B>SOCK_STREAM</B>

to open a
<B><A HREF="../man7/tcp.7.html">tcp</A></B>(7)

socket,
<B>SOCK_DGRAM</B>

to open a
<B><A HREF="../man7/udp.7.html">udp</A></B>(7)

socket, or
<B>SOCK_RAW</B>

to open a
<B><A HREF="../man7/raw.7.html">raw</A></B>(7)

socket to access the IP protocol directly.
<I>protocol</I>

is the IP protocol in the IP header to be received or sent.
The only valid values for
<I>protocol</I>

are
<B>0</B>

and
<B>IPPROTO_TCP</B>

for TCP sockets and
<B>0</B>

and
<B>IPPROTO_UDP</B>

for UDP sockets.
For
<B>SOCK_RAW</B>

you may specify
a valid IANA IP protocol defined in
RFC&nbsp;1700
assigned numbers.
<P>



When a process wants to receive new incoming packets or connections, it
should bind a socket to a local interface address using
<B><A HREF="../man2/bind.2.html">bind</A></B>(2).

Only one IP socket may be bound to any given local (address, port) pair.
When
<B>INADDR_ANY</B>

is specified in the bind call the socket will be bound to
<I>all</I>

local interfaces.
When
<B><A HREF="../man2/listen.2.html">listen</A></B>(2)

or
<B><A HREF="../man2/connect.2.html">connect</A></B>(2)

are called on an unbound socket, it is automatically bound to a
random free port with the local address set to
<B>INADDR_ANY</B>.

<P>
A TCP local socket address that has been bound is unavailable for
some time after closing,
unless the
<B>SO_REUSEADDR</B>

flag has been set.
Care should be taken when using this flag as it
makes TCP less reliable.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Address Format</H3>

An IP socket address is defined as a combination of an IP interface
address and a 16-bit port number.
The basic IP protocol does not supply port numbers, they
are implemented by higher level protocols like
<B><A HREF="../man7/udp.7.html">udp</A></B>(7)

and
<B><A HREF="../man7/tcp.7.html">tcp</A></B>(7).

On raw sockets
<I>sin_port</I>

is set to the IP protocol.
<P>


<PRE>
struct sockaddr_in {
    sa_family_t    sin_family; /* address family: AF_INET */
    u_int16_t      sin_port;   /* port in network byte order */
    struct in_addr sin_addr;   /* internet address */
};

/* Internet address. */
struct in_addr {
    u_int32_t      s_addr;     /* address in network byte order */
};
</PRE>


<P>

<I>sin_family</I>

is always set to
<B>AF_INET</B>.

This is required; in Linux 2.2 most networking functions return
<B>EINVAL</B>

when this setting is missing.
<I>sin_port</I>

contains the port in network byte order.
The port numbers below 1024 are called
<I>reserved ports</I>.

Only privileged processes (i.e., those having the
<B>CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE</B>

capability) may
<B><A HREF="../man2/bind.2.html">bind</A></B>(2)

to these sockets.
Note that the raw IPv4 protocol as such has no concept of a
port, they are only implemented by higher protocols like
<B><A HREF="../man7/tcp.7.html">tcp</A></B>(7)

and
<B><A HREF="../man7/udp.7.html">udp</A></B>(7).

<P>

<I>sin_addr</I>

is the IP host address.
The
<I>s_addr</I>

member of
<I>struct in_addr</I>

contains the host interface address in network byte order.
<I>in_addr</I>

should be assigned one of the INADDR_* values (e.g.,
<B>INADDR_ANY</B>)

or set using the
<B><A HREF="../man3/inet_aton.3.html">inet_aton</A></B>(3),

<B><A HREF="../man3/inet_addr.3.html">inet_addr</A></B>(3),

<B><A HREF="../man3/inet_makeaddr.3.html">inet_makeaddr</A></B>(3)

library functions or directly with the name resolver (see
<B><A HREF="../man3/gethostbyname.3.html">gethostbyname</A></B>(3)).

IPv4 addresses are divided into unicast, broadcast
and multicast addresses.
Unicast addresses specify a single interface of a host,
broadcast addresses specify all hosts on a network and multicast
addresses address all hosts in a multicast group.
Datagrams to broadcast addresses can be only sent or received when the
<B>SO_BROADCAST</B>

socket flag is set.
In the current implementation connection oriented sockets are only allowed
to use unicast addresses.

<P>
Note that the address and the port are always stored in
network byte order.
In particular, this means that you need to call
<B><A HREF="../man3/htons.3.html">htons</A></B>(3)

on the number that is assigned to a port.
All address/port manipulation
functions in the standard library work in network byte order.
<P>
There are several special addresses:
<B>INADDR_LOOPBACK</B>

(127.0.0.1)
always refers to the local host via the loopback device;
<B>INADDR_ANY</B>

(0.0.0.0)
means any address for binding;
<B>INADDR_BROADCAST</B>

(255.255.255.255)
means any host and has the same effect on bind as
<B>INADDR_ANY</B>

for historical reasons.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Socket Options</H3>

IP supports some protocol specific socket options that can be set with
<B><A HREF="../man2/setsockopt.2.html">setsockopt</A></B>(2)

and read with
<B><A HREF="../man2/getsockopt.2.html">getsockopt</A></B>(2).

The socket option level for IP is
<B>IPPROTO_IP</B>.


A boolean integer flag is zero when it is false, otherwise true.



<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>IP_OPTIONS</B>

<DD>
Sets or get the IP options to be sent with every packet from this
socket.
The arguments are a pointer to a memory buffer containing the options
and the option length.
The
<B><A HREF="../man2/setsockopt.2.html">setsockopt</A></B>(2)

call sets the IP options associated with a socket.
The maximum option size for IPv4 is 40 bytes.
See RFC&nbsp;791 for the allowed
options.
When the initial connection request packet for a
<B>SOCK_STREAM</B>

socket contains IP options, the IP options will be set automatically
to the options from the initial packet with routing headers reversed.
Incoming packets are not allowed to change options after the connection
is established.
The processing of all incoming source routing options
is disabled by default and can be enabled by using the
<B>accept_source_route</B>

sysctl.
Other options like timestamps are still handled.
For datagram sockets, IP options can be only set by the local user.
Calling
<B><A HREF="../man2/getsockopt.2.html">getsockopt</A></B>(2)

with
<B>IP_OPTIONS</B>

puts the current IP options used for sending into the supplied buffer.
<DT><B>IP_PKTINFO</B>

<DD>
Pass an
<B>IP_PKTINFO</B>

ancillary message that contains a
<I>pktinfo</I>

structure that supplies some information about the incoming packet.
This only works for datagram oriented sockets.
The argument is a flag that tells the socket whether the IP_PKTINFO
message should be passed or not.
The message itself can only be sent/retrieved
as control message with a packet using
<B><A HREF="../man2/recvmsg.2.html">recvmsg</A></B>(2)

or
<B><A HREF="../man2/sendmsg.2.html">sendmsg</A></B>(2).

<DT><DD>

<PRE>
struct in_pktinfo {
    unsigned int   ipi_ifindex;  /* Interface index */
    struct in_addr ipi_spec_dst; /* Local address */
    struct in_addr ipi_addr;     /* Header Destination
                                    address */
};
</PRE>


<DT><DD>

<I>ipi_ifindex</I>

is the unique index of the interface the packet was received on.
<I>ipi_spec_dst</I>

is the local address of the packet and
<I>ipi_addr</I>

is the destination address in the packet header.
If
<B>IP_PKTINFO</B>

is passed to
<B><A HREF="../man2/sendmsg.2.html">sendmsg</A></B>(2)

and

<I>ipi_spec_dst</I>

is not zero, then it is used as the local source address for the routing
table lookup and for setting up IP source route options.
When
<I>ipi_ifindex</I>

is not zero the primary local address of the interface specified by the
index overwrites
<I>ipi_spec_dst</I>

for the routing table lookup.
<DT><B>IP_RECVTOS</B>

<DD>
If enabled the
<B>IP_TOS</B>

ancillary message is passed with incoming packets.
It contains a byte which specifies the Type of Service/Precedence
field of the packet header.
Expects a boolean integer flag.
<DT><B>IP_RECVTTL</B>

<DD>
When this flag is set
pass a
<B>IP_TTL</B>

control message with the time to live
field of the received packet as a byte.
Not supported for
<B>SOCK_STREAM</B>

sockets.
<DT><B>IP_RECVOPTS</B>

<DD>
Pass all incoming IP options to the user in a
<B>IP_OPTIONS</B>

control message.
The routing header and other options are already filled in
for the local host.
Not supported for
<B>SOCK_STREAM</B>

sockets.
<DT><B>IP_RETOPTS</B>

<DD>
Identical to
<B>IP_RECVOPTS</B>

but returns raw unprocessed options with timestamp and route record
options not filled in for this hop.
<DT><B>IP_TOS</B>

<DD>
Set or receive the Type-Of-Service (TOS) field that is sent
with every IP packet originating from this socket.
It is used to prioritize packets on the network.
TOS is a byte.
There are some standard TOS flags defined:
<B>IPTOS_LOWDELAY</B>

to minimize delays for interactive traffic,
<B>IPTOS_THROUGHPUT</B>

to optimize throughput,
<B>IPTOS_RELIABILITY</B>

to optimize for reliability,
<B>IPTOS_MINCOST</B>

should be used for &quot;filler data&quot; where slow transmission doesn't matter.
At most one of these TOS values can be specified.
Other bits are invalid and shall be cleared.
Linux sends
<B>IPTOS_LOWDELAY</B>

datagrams first by default,
but the exact behavior depends on the configured queueing discipline.

Some high priority levels may require superuser privileges (the
<B>CAP_NET_ADMIN</B>

capability).
The priority can also be set in a protocol independent way by the
(<B>SOL_SOCKET</B>, <B>SO_PRIORITY</B>)

socket option (see
<B><A HREF="../man7/socket.7.html">socket</A></B>(7)).

<DT><B>IP_TTL</B>

<DD>
Set or retrieve the current time to live field that is used in every packet
sent from this socket.
<DT><B>IP_HDRINCL</B>

<DD>
If enabled
the user supplies an IP header in front of the user data.
Only valid for
<B>SOCK_RAW</B>

sockets.
See
<B><A HREF="../man7/raw.7.html">raw</A></B>(7)

for more information.
When this flag is enabled the values set by
<B>IP_OPTIONS</B>,

<B>IP_TTL</B>

and
<B>IP_TOS</B>

are ignored.
<DT><B>IP_RECVERR</B> (defined in <I>&lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/linux/errqueue.h">linux/errqueue.h</A>&gt;</I>)

<DD>
Enable extended reliable error message passing.
When enabled on a datagram socket all
generated errors will be queued in a per-socket error queue.
When the user
receives an error from a socket operation the errors can
be received by calling
<B><A HREF="../man2/recvmsg.2.html">recvmsg</A></B>(2)

with the
<B>MSG_ERRQUEUE</B>

flag set.
The
<I>sock_extended_err</I>

structure describing the error will be passed in a ancillary message with
the type
<B>IP_RECVERR</B>

and the level
<B>IPPROTO_IP</B>.


This is useful for reliable error handling on unconnected sockets.
The received data portion of the error queue
contains the error packet.
<DT><DD>
The
<B>IP_RECVERR</B>

control message contains a
<I>sock_extended_err</I>

structure:
<DT><DD>


<PRE>
#define SO_EE_ORIGIN_NONE    0
#define SO_EE_ORIGIN_LOCAL   1
#define SO_EE_ORIGIN_ICMP    2
#define SO_EE_ORIGIN_ICMP6   3

struct sock_extended_err {
    u_int32_t ee_errno;   /* error number */
    u_int8_t  ee_origin;  /* where the error originated */
    u_int8_t  ee_type;    /* type */
    u_int8_t  ee_code;    /* code */
    u_int8_t  ee_pad;
    u_int32_t ee_info;    /* additional information */
    u_int32_t ee_data;    /* other data */
    /* More data may follow */
};

struct sockaddr *SO_EE_OFFENDER(struct sock_extended_err *);
</PRE>


<DT><DD>
<I>ee_errno</I>

contains the
<I>errno</I>

number of the queued error.
<I>ee_origin</I>

is the origin code of where the error originated.
The other fields are protocol specific.
The macro
<B>SO_EE_OFFENDER</B>

returns a pointer to the address of the network object
where the error originated from given a pointer to the ancillary message.
If this address is not known, the
<I>sa_family</I>

member of the
<I>sockaddr</I>

contains
<B>AF_UNSPEC</B>

and the other fields of the
<I>sockaddr</I>

are undefined.
<DT><DD>
IP uses the
<I>sock_extended_err</I>

structure as follows:
<I>ee_origin</I>

is set to
<B>SO_EE_ORIGIN_ICMP</B>

for errors received as an ICMP packet, or
<B>SO_EE_ORIGIN_LOCAL</B>

for locally generated errors.
Unknown values should be ignored.
<I>ee_type</I>

and
<I>ee_code</I>

are set from the type and code fields of the ICMP header.
<I>ee_info</I>

contains the discovered MTU for
<B>EMSGSIZE</B>

errors.
The message also contains the
<I>sockaddr_in of the node</I>

caused the error, which can be accessed with the
<B>SO_EE_OFFENDER</B>

macro.
The
<I>sin_family</I>

field of the SO_EE_OFFENDER address is
<B>AF_UNSPEC</B>

when the source was unknown.
When the error originated from the network, all IP options
(<I>IP_OPTIONS</I>, <I>IP_TTL</I>, 

etc.) enabled on the socket and contained in the
error packet are passed as control messages.
The payload of the packet
causing the error is returned as normal payload.














Note that TCP has no error queue;
<B>MSG_ERRQUEUE</B>

is illegal on
<B>SOCK_STREAM</B>

sockets.
<B>IP_RECVERR</B>

is valid for TCP, but all errors are
returned by socket function return or
<B>SO_ERROR</B>

only.
<DT><DD>
For raw sockets,
<B>IP_RECVERR</B>

enables passing of all received ICMP errors to the
application, otherwise errors are only reported on connected sockets
<DT><DD>
It sets or retrieves an integer boolean flag.
<B>IP_RECVERR</B>

defaults to off.
<DT><B>IP_MTU_DISCOVER</B>

<DD>
Sets or receives the Path MTU Discovery setting
for a socket.
When enabled, Linux will perform Path MTU Discovery
as defined in RFC&nbsp;1191
on this socket.
The don't fragment flag is set on all outgoing datagrams.
The system-wide default is controlled by the
<B>ip_no_pmtu_disc</B>

sysctl for
<B>SOCK_STREAM</B>

sockets, and disabled on all others.
For non
<B>SOCK_STREAM</B>

sockets it is the user's responsibility to packetize the data
in MTU sized chunks and to do the retransmits if necessary.
The kernel will reject packets that are bigger than the known
path MTU if this flag is set (with
<B>EMSGSIZE</B>

).
<TABLE>
<TR VALIGN=top><TD ALIGN=center>Path MTU discovery flags</TD><TD>Meaning<BR></TD></TR>
<TR VALIGN=top><TD>IP_PMTUDISC_WANT</TD><TD>Use per-route settings.<BR></TD></TR>
<TR VALIGN=top><TD>IP_PMTUDISC_DONT</TD><TD>Never do Path MTU Discovery.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR VALIGN=top><TD>IP_PMTUDISC_PROBE</TD><TD>Set DF but ignore Path MTU.<BR></TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P>
When PMTU discovery is enabled the kernel automatically keeps track of
the path MTU per destination host.
When it is connected to a specific peer with
<B><A HREF="../man2/connect.2.html">connect</A></B>(2)

the currently known path MTU can be retrieved conveniently using the
<B>IP_MTU</B>

socket option (e.g., after a
<B>EMSGSIZE</B>

error occurred).
It may change over time.
For connectionless sockets with many destinations
the new also MTU for a given destination can also be accessed using the
error queue (see
<B>IP_RECVERR</B>).

A new error will be queued for every incoming MTU update.
<P>
While MTU discovery is in progress initial packets from datagram sockets
may be dropped.
Applications using UDP should be aware of this and not
take it into account for their packet retransmit strategy.
<P>
To bootstrap the path MTU discovery process on unconnected sockets it
is possible to start with a big datagram size
(up to 64K-headers bytes long) and let it shrink by updates of the
path MTU.

<P>
To get an initial estimate of the
path MTU connect a datagram socket to the destination address using
<B><A HREF="../man2/connect.2.html">connect</A></B>(2)

and retrieve the MTU by calling
<B><A HREF="../man2/getsockopt.2.html">getsockopt</A></B>(2)

with the
<B>IP_MTU</B>

option.
<P>
It is possible to implement RFC 4821 MTU probing with
<B>SOCK_DGRAM</B>

or
<B>SOCK_RAW</B>

sockets by setting a value of
<B>IP_PMTUDISC_PROBE</B>.

This is also particularly useful for diagnostic tools such as
<B><A HREF="../man8/tracepath.8.html">tracepath</A></B>(8)

that wish to deliberately send probe packets larger than
the observed Path MTU.
<DT><B>IP_MTU</B>

<DD>
Retrieve the current known path MTU of the current socket.
Only valid when the socket has been connected.
Returns an integer.
Only valid as a
<B><A HREF="../man2/getsockopt.2.html">getsockopt</A></B>(2).


<DT><B>IP_ROUTER_ALERT</B>

<DD>
Pass all to-be forwarded packets with the
IP Router Alert
option
set to this socket.
Only valid for raw sockets.
This is useful, for instance, for user
space RSVP daemons.
The tapped packets are not forwarded by the kernel, it is
the users responsibility to send them out again.
Socket binding is ignored,
such packets are only filtered by protocol.
Expects an integer flag.

<DT><B>IP_MULTICAST_TTL</B>

<DD>
Set or reads the time-to-live value of outgoing multicast packets for this
socket.
It is very important for multicast packets to set the smallest TTL possible.
The default is 1 which means that multicast packets don't leave the local
network unless the user program explicitly requests it.
Argument is an
integer.

<DT><B>IP_MULTICAST_LOOP</B>

<DD>
Sets or reads a boolean integer argument whether sent multicast
packets should be looped back to the local sockets.

<DT><B>IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP</B>

<DD>
Join a multicast group.
Argument is an
<I>ip_mreqn</I>

structure.
<P>

<PRE>
struct ip_mreqn {
    struct in_addr imr_multiaddr; /* IP multicast group
                                     address */
    struct in_addr imr_address;   /* IP address of local
                                     interface */
    int            imr_ifindex;   /* interface index */
};
</PRE>


<P>
<I>imr_multiaddr</I>

contains the address of the multicast group the application
wants to join or leave.
It must be a valid multicast address.
<I>imr_address</I>

is the address of the local interface with which the system
should join the multicast
group; if it is equal to
<B>INADDR_ANY</B>

an appropriate interface is chosen by the system.
<I>imr_ifindex</I>

is the interface index of the interface that should join/leave the
<I>imr_multiaddr</I>

group, or 0 to indicate any interface.
<DT><DD>
For compatibility, the old
<I>ip_mreq</I>

structure is still supported.
It differs from
<I>ip_mreqn</I>

only by not including
the
<I>imr_ifindex</I>

field.
Only valid as a
<B><A HREF="../man2/setsockopt.2.html">setsockopt</A></B>(2).


<DT><B>IP_DROP_MEMBERSHIP</B>

<DD>
Leave a multicast group.
Argument is an
<I>ip_mreqn</I>

or
<I>ip_mreq</I>

structure similar to
<B>IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP</B>.


<DT><B>IP_MULTICAST_IF</B>

<DD>
Set the local device for a multicast socket.
Argument is an
<I>ip_mreqn</I>

or
<I>ip_mreq</I>

structure similar to
<B>IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP</B>.

<DT><DD>
When an invalid socket option is passed,
<B>ENOPROTOOPT</B>

is returned.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Sysctls</H3>

The IP protocol
supports the sysctl interface to configure some global options.
The sysctls can be accessed by reading or writing the
<I>/proc/sys/net/ipv4/*</I>

files or using the



<B><A HREF="../man2/sysctl.2.html">sysctl</A></B>(2)

interface.
Variables described as
<I>Boolean</I>

take an integer value, with a non-zero value (&quot;true&quot;) meaning that
the corresponding option is enabled, and a zero value (&quot;false&quot;)
meaning that the option is disabled.

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>ip_always_defrag</B> (Boolean)

<DD>
[New with kernel 2.2.13; in earlier kernel version the feature
was controlled at compile time by the
<B>CONFIG_IP_ALWAYS_DEFRAG</B>

option; this file is not present in 2.4.x and later]
<P>
When this boolean frag is enabled (not equal 0) incoming fragments
(parts of IP packets
that arose when some host between origin and destination decided
that the packets were too large and cut them into pieces) will be
reassembled (defragmented) before being processed, even if they are
about to be forwarded.
<P>
Only enable if running either a firewall that is the sole link
to your network or a transparent proxy; never ever turn on here for a
normal router or host.
Otherwise fragmented communication may me disturbed
when the fragments would travel over different links.
Defragmentation
also has a large memory and CPU time cost.
<P>
This is automagically turned on when masquerading or transparent
proxying are configured.

<DT><B>ip_autoconfig</B>

<DD>

Not documented.

<DT><B>ip_default_ttl</B> (integer; default: 64)

<DD>
Set the default time-to-live value of outgoing packets.
This can be changed per socket with the
<B>IP_TTL</B>

option.

<DT><B>ip_dynaddr</B> (Boolean; default: disabled)

<DD>
Enable dynamic socket address and masquerading entry rewriting on interface
address change.
This is useful for dialup interface with changing IP addresses.
0 means no rewriting, 1 turns it on and 2 enables verbose mode.

<DT><B>ip_forward</B> (Boolean; default: disabled)

<DD>
Enable IP forwarding with a boolean flag.
IP forwarding can be also set on a per interface basis.

<DT><B>ip_local_port_range</B>

<DD>
Contains two integers that define the default local port range
allocated to sockets.
Allocation starts with the first number and ends with the second number.
Note that these should not conflict with the ports used by masquerading
(although the case is handled).
Also arbitrary choices may cause problems with some firewall packet
filters that make assumptions about the local ports in use.
First number should be at least &gt;1024, better &gt;4096 to avoid clashes
with well known ports and to minimize firewall problems.

<DT><B>ip_no_pmtu_disc</B> (Boolean; default: disabled)

<DD>
If enabled, don't do Path MTU Discovery for TCP sockets by default.
Path MTU discovery may fail if misconfigured firewalls (that drop
all ICMP packets) or misconfigured interfaces (e.g., a point-to-point
link where the both ends don't agree on the MTU) are on the path.
It is better to fix the broken routers on the path than to turn off
Path MTU Discovery globally, because not doing it incurs a high cost
to the network.


<DT><B>ip_nonlocal_bind</B> (Boolean; default: disabled)

<DD>
If set, allows processes to
<B><A HREF="../man2/bind.2.html">bind</A></B>(2)

to non-local IP addresses,
which can be quite useful, but may break some applications.


<DT><B>ip6frag_time</B> (integer; default 30)

<DD>
Time in seconds to keep an IPv6 fragment in memory.


<DT><B>ip6frag_secret_interval</B> (integer; default 600)

<DD>
Regeneration interval (in seconds) of the hash secret (or lifetime
for the hash secret) for IPv6 fragments.
<DT><B>ipfrag_high_thresh</B> (integer), <B>ipfrag_low_thresh</B> (integer)

<DD>
If the amount of queued IP fragments reaches
<B>ipfrag_high_thresh</B>,

the queue
is pruned down to
<B>ipfrag_low_thresh</B>.

Contains an integer with the number of
bytes.
<DT><B>neigh/*</B>

<H2>ERRORS</H2>




<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EACCES</B>

<DD>
The user tried to execute an operation without the necessary permissions.
These include:
sending a packet to a broadcast address without having the
<B>SO_BROADCAST</B>

flag set;
sending a packet via a
<I>prohibit</I>

route;
modifying firewall settings without superuser privileges (the
<B>CAP_NET_ADMIN</B>

capability);
binding to a reserved port without superuser privileges (the
<B>CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE</B>

capability).
<DT><B>EADDRINUSE</B>

<DD>
Tried to bind to an address already in use.
<DT><B>EADDRNOTAVAIL</B>

<DD>
A non-existent interface was requested or the requested source
address was
not local.
<DT><B>EAGAIN</B>

<DD>
Operation on a non-blocking socket would block.
<DT><B>EALREADY</B>

<DD>
An connection operation on a non-blocking socket is already in progress.
<DT><B>ECONNABORTED</B>

<DD>
A connection was closed during an
<B><A HREF="../man2/accept.2.html">accept</A></B>(2).

<DT><B>EHOSTUNREACH</B>

<DD>
No valid routing table entry matches the destination address.
This error can be caused by a ICMP message from a remote router or
for the local routing table.
<DT><B>EINVAL</B>

<DD>
Invalid argument passed.
For send operations this can be caused by sending to a
<I>blackhole</I>

route.
<DT><B>EISCONN</B>

<DD>
<B><A HREF="../man2/connect.2.html">connect</A></B>(2)

was called on an already connected socket.
<DT><B>EMSGSIZE</B>

<DD>
Datagram is bigger than an MTU on the path and it cannot be fragmented.
<DT><B>ENOBUFS</B>, <B>ENOMEM</B>

<DD>
Not enough free memory.
This often means that the memory allocation is limited by the socket
buffer limits, not by the system memory, but this is not
100% consistent.
<DT><B>ENOENT</B>

<DD>
<B>SIOCGSTAMP</B>

was called on a socket where no packet arrived.
<DT><B>ENOPKG</B>

<DD>
A kernel subsystem was not configured.
<DT><B>ENOPROTOOPT</B> and <B>EOPNOTSUPP</B>

<DD>
Invalid socket option passed.
<DT><B>ENOTCONN</B>

<DD>
The operation is only defined on a connected socket, but the socket wasn't
connected.
<DT><B>EPERM</B>

<DD>
User doesn't have permission to set high priority, change configuration,
or send signals to the requested process or group.
<DT><B>EPIPE</B>

<DD>
The connection was unexpectedly closed or shut down by the other end.
<DT><B>ESOCKTNOSUPPORT</B>

<DD>
The socket is not configured or an unknown socket type was requested.

<H2>VERSIONS</H2>

<B>IP_MTU</B>,

<B>IP_MTU_DISCOVER</B>,

<B>IP_PKTINFO</B>,

<B>IP_RECVERR</B>

and
<B>IP_ROUTER_ALERT</B>

are new options in Linux 2.2.
They are also all Linux specific and should not be used in
programs intended to be portable.
<P>



<B>IP_PMTUDISC_PROBE</B>

is new in Linux 2.6.22.
<P>

<I>struct ip_mreqn</I>

is new in Linux 2.2.
Linux 2.0 only supported
<B>ip_mreq</B>.

<P>

The sysctls were introduced with Linux 2.2.
<A NAME="lbAK">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NOTES</H2>

Be very careful with the
<B>SO_BROADCAST</B>

option - it is not privileged in Linux.
It is easy to overload the network
with careless broadcasts.
For new application protocols
it is better to use a multicast group instead of broadcasting.
Broadcasting is discouraged.
<P>

Some other BSD sockets implementations provide
<B>IP_RCVDSTADDR</B>

and
<B>IP_RECVIF</B>

socket options to get the destination address and the interface of
received datagrams.
Linux has the more general
<B>IP_PKTINFO</B>

for the same task.
<P>

Some BSD sockets implementations also provide an
<B>IP_RECVTTL</B>

option, but an ancillary message with type
<B>IP_RECVTTL</B>

is passed with the incoming packet.
This is different from the
<B>IP_TTL</B>

option used in Linux.
<P>

Using
<B>SOL_IP</B>

socket options level isn't portable, BSD-based stacks use
<B>IPPROTO_IP</B>

level.
<A NAME="lbAL">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Compatibility</H3>

For compatibility with Linux 2.0, the obsolete
<B>socket(PF_INET, SOCK_PACKET, </B><I>protocol</I><B>)</B>

syntax is still supported to open a
<B><A HREF="../man7/packet.7.html">packet</A></B>(7)

socket.
This is deprecated and should be replaced by
<B>socket(PF_PACKET, SOCK_RAW, </B><I>protocol</I><B>)</B>

instead.
The main difference is the new
<I>sockaddr_ll</I>

address structure for generic link layer information instead of the old
<B>sockaddr_pkt</B>.

<A NAME="lbAM">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>BUGS</H2>

There are too many inconsistent error values.
<P>

The ioctls to configure IP-specific interface options and ARP tables are
not described.
<P>

Some versions of glibc forget to declare
<I>in_pktinfo</I>.

Workaround currently is to copy it into your program from this man page.
<P>
