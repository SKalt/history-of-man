<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

This manual page describes the Linux networking socket layer user 
interface. The BSD compatible sockets
are the uniform interface
between the user process and the network protocol stacks in the kernel.
The protocol modules are grouped into 
<I>protocol families</I>

like
<B>PF_INET</B>, <B>PF_IPX</B>, <B>PF_PACKET</B>

and
<I>socket types</I>

like
<B>SOCK_STREAM</B>

or
<B>SOCK_DGRAM</B>.

See 
<B><A HREF="../man2/socket.2.html">socket</A></B>(2)

for more information on families and types.
<P>
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SOCKET LAYER FUNCTIONS</H2>

These functions are used by the user process to send or receive packets 
and to do other socket operations. 
For more information see their respective manual pages.
<P>
<B><A HREF="../man2/socket.2.html">socket</A></B>(2)

creates a socket,
<B><A HREF="../man2/connect.2.html">connect</A></B>(2)

connects a socket to a remote socket address,
the 
<B><A HREF="../man2/bind.2.html">bind</A></B>(2)

function binds a socket to a local socket address,
<B><A HREF="../man2/listen.2.html">listen</A></B>(2)

tells the socket that new connections shall be accepted, and
<B><A HREF="../man2/accept.2.html">accept</A></B>(2)

is used to get a new socket with a new incoming connection.
<B><A HREF="../man2/socketpair.2.html">socketpair</A></B>(2)

returns two connected anonymous sockets (only implemented for a few
local families like
<B>PF_UNIX</B>)

<P>

<B><A HREF="../man2/send.2.html">send</A></B>(2),

<B><A HREF="../man2/sendto.2.html">sendto</A></B>(2),

and
<B><A HREF="../man2/sendmsg.2.html">sendmsg</A></B>(2)

send data over a socket, and
<B><A HREF="../man2/recv.2.html">recv</A></B>(2),

<B><A HREF="../man2/recvfrom.2.html">recvfrom</A></B>(2),

<B><A HREF="../man2/recvmsg.2.html">recvmsg</A></B>(2)

receive data from a socket.
<B><A HREF="../man2/poll.2.html">poll</A></B>(2)

and
<B><A HREF="../man2/select.2.html">select</A></B>(2)

wait for arriving data or a readiness to send data.
In addition, the standard I/O operations like 
<B><A HREF="../man2/write.2.html">write</A></B>(2),

<B><A HREF="../man2/writev.2.html">writev</A></B>(2),

<B><A HREF="../man2/sendfile.2.html">sendfile</A></B>(2),

<B><A HREF="../man2/read.2.html">read</A></B>(2),

and  
<B><A HREF="../man2/readv.2.html">readv</A></B>(2)

can be used to read and write data.
<P>

<B><A HREF="../man2/getsockname.2.html">getsockname</A></B>(2)

returns the local socket address and
<B><A HREF="../man2/getpeername.2.html">getpeername</A></B>(2)

returns the remote socket address.
<B><A HREF="../man2/getsockopt.2.html">getsockopt</A></B>(2)

and
<B><A HREF="../man2/setsockopt.2.html">setsockopt</A></B>(2)

are used to set or get socket layer or protocol options. 
<B><A HREF="../man2/ioctl.2.html">ioctl</A></B>(2)

can be used to set or read some other options.
<P>

<B><A HREF="../man2/close.2.html">close</A></B>(2)

is used to close a socket.
<B><A HREF="../man2/shutdown.2.html">shutdown</A></B>(2)

closes parts of a full duplex socket connection. 
<P>

Seeking, or calling 
<B><A HREF="../man2/pread.2.html">pread</A></B>(2)

or 
<B><A HREF="../man2/pwrite.2.html">pwrite</A></B>(2)

with a non-zero position is not supported on sockets.
<P>

It is possible to do non-blocking I/O on sockets by setting the 
<B>O_NONBLOCK</B>

flag on a socket file descriptor using
<B><A HREF="../man2/fcntl.2.html">fcntl</A></B>(2).

Then all operations that would block will (usually)
return with
<B>EAGAIN </B>

(operation should be retried later);
<B><A HREF="../man2/connect.2.html">connect</A></B>(2)

will return 
<B>EINPROGRESS</B>

error. 
The user can then wait for various events via
<B><A HREF="../man2/poll.2.html">poll</A></B>(2)

or
<B><A HREF="../man2/select.2.html">select</A></B>(2).

An alternative to 
<B>poll</B>()

and
<B>select</B>()

is to let the kernel inform the application about events
via a
<B>SIGIO</B>

signal. For that the
<B>FASYNC</B>

flag must be set on a socket file descriptor via
<B><A HREF="../man2/fcntl.2.html">fcntl</A></B>(2)

and a valid signal handler for 
<B>SIGIO</B>

must be installed via 
<B><A HREF="../man2/sigaction.2.html">sigaction</A></B>(2).

See the
<I>SIGNALS</I>

discussion below.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SOCKET OPTIONS</H2>

These socket options can be set by using
<B><A HREF="../man2/setsockopt.2.html">setsockopt</A></B>(2)

and read with 
<B><A HREF="../man2/getsockopt.2.html">getsockopt</A></B>(2)

with the socket level set to 
<B>SOL_SOCKET </B>

for all sockets:


<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>SO_ACCEPTCONN</B>

<DD>
Returns a value indicating whether or not this socket has been marked
to accept connections with
<B>listen</B>().

The value 0 indicates that this is not a listening socket,
the value 1 indicates that this is a listening socket.
Can only be read
with 
<B>getsockopt</B>().

<DT><B>SO_BINDTODEVICE</B>

<DD>
Bind this socket to a particular device like "eth0",
as specified in the passed interface name. If the
name is an empty string or the option length is zero, the socket device
binding is removed. The passed option is a variable-length null terminated
interface name string with the maximum size of 
<B>IFNAMSIZ</B>.

If a socket is bound to an interface,
only packets received from that particular interface are processed by the 
socket. Note that this only works for some socket types, particularly
<B>AF_INET</B>

sockets. It is not supported for packet sockets (use normal 
<B><A HREF="../man8/bind.8.html">bind</A></B>(8)

there).
<DT><B>SO_BROADCAST</B>

<DD>
Set or get the broadcast flag. When enabled, datagram sockets
receive packets sent to a broadcast address and they are allowed to send 
packets to a broadcast address.
This option has no effect on stream-oriented sockets.
<DT><B>SO_BSDCOMPAT</B>

<DD>
Enable BSD bug-to-bug compatibility. 
This is used by the UDP protocol module in Linux 2.0 and 2.2.
If enabled ICMP errors received for a UDP socket will not be passed
to the user program. 
In later kernel versions, support for this option has been phased out:
Linux 2.4 silently ignores it, and Linux 2.6 generates a kernel warning
(printk()) if a program uses this option.
Linux 2.0 also enabled BSD bug-to-bug compatibility 
options (random header changing, skipping of the broadcast flag) for raw
sockets with this option, but that was removed in Linux 2.2. 
<DT><B>SO_DEBUG </B>

<DD>
Enable socket debugging. Only allowed for processes with the
<B>CAP_NET_ADMIN</B>

capability or an effective user ID of 0.
<DT><B>SO_ERROR</B>

<DD>
Get and clear the pending socket error. Only valid as a 
<B>getsockopt</B>().

Expects an integer. 
<DT><B>SO_DONTROUTE</B>

<DD>
Don't send via a gateway, only send to directly connected hosts.
The same effect can be achieved by setting the 
<B>MSG_DONTROUTE</B>

flag on a socket 
<B><A HREF="../man2/send.2.html">send</A></B>(2)

operation. Expects an integer boolean flag. 
<DT><B>SO_KEEPALIVE</B>

<DD>
Enable sending of keep-alive messages on connection-oriented sockets. 
Expects an integer boolean flag. 
<DT><B>SO_LINGER</B>

<DD>
Sets or gets the 
<B>SO_LINGER </B>

option. The argument is a 
<I>linger </I>

structure.
<P>

<PRE>
struct linger {
    int l_onoff;    /* linger active */
    int l_linger;   /* how many seconds to linger for */
};
</PRE>


<DT><DD>
When enabled, a 
<B><A HREF="../man2/close.2.html">close</A></B>(2)

or
<B><A HREF="../man2/shutdown.2.html">shutdown</A></B>(2)

will not return until all queued messages for the socket have been
successfully sent or the linger timeout has been reached. Otherwise,
the call returns immediately and the closing is done in the background.
When the socket is closed as part of
<B><A HREF="../man2/exit.2.html">exit</A></B>(2),

it always lingers in the background.
<DT><B>SO_OOBINLINE</B>

<DD>
If this option is enabled, 
out-of-band data is directly placed into the receive data stream. 
Otherwise out-of-band data is only passed when the 
<B>MSG_OOB </B>

flag is set during receiving. 


<DT><B>SO_PASSCRED</B>

<DD>
Enable or disable the receiving of the
<B>SCM_CREDENTIALS</B>

control message. For more information see 
<B><A HREF="../man7/unix.7.html">unix</A></B>(7).

<DT><B>SO_PEERCRED</B>

<DD>
Return the credentials of the foreign process connected to this socket. 
This is only possible for connected
<B>PF_UNIX </B>

stream sockets and
<B>PF_UNIX </B>

stream and datagram socket pairs created using
<B><A HREF="../man2/socketpair.2.html">socketpair</A></B>(2);

see 
<B><A HREF="../man7/unix.7.html">unix</A></B>(7).

The returned credentials are those that were in effect at the time
of the call to
<B><A HREF="../man2/connect.2.html">connect</A></B>(2)

or
<B><A HREF="../man2/socketpair.2.html">socketpair</A></B>(2).

Argument is a
<I>ucred </I>

structure. 
Only valid as a 
<B>getsockopt</B>().

<DT><B>SO_PRIORITY</B>

<DD>
Set the protocol-defined priority for all packets to be sent on 
this socket.
Linux uses this value to order the networking queues: 
packets with a higher priority may be processed first depending 
on the selected device queueing discipline. 
For
<B><A HREF="../man7/ip.7.html">ip</A></B>(7),

this also sets the IP type-of-service (TOS) field for outgoing packets.  
Setting a priority outside the range 0 to 6 requires the
<B>CAP_NET_ADMIN</B>

capability.
<DT><B>SO_RCVBUF</B>

<DD>
Sets or gets the maximum socket receive buffer in bytes. 
The kernel doubles this value (to allow space for bookkeeping overhead) 
when it is set using

<B>setsockopt</B>(),

and this doubled value is returned by
<B>getsockopt</B>().

The default value is set by the 
<B>rmem_default </B>

sysctl and the maximum allowed value is set by the 
<B>rmem_max</B>

sysctl.   
The minimum (doubled) value for this option is 256.
<DT><B>SO_RCVBUFFORCE</B> (since Linux 2.6.14)

<DD>
Using this socket option, a privileged
(<B>CAP_NET_ADMIN</B>)

process can perform the same task as 
<B>SO_RCVBUF</B>,

but the 
<B>rmem_max</B>

limit can be overridden.
<DT><B>SO_RCVLOWAT</B> and <B>SO_SNDLOWAT</B>

<DD>
Specify the minimum number of bytes in the buffer until the socket layer
will pass the data to the protocol 
(<B>SO_SNDLOWAT</B>)

or the user on receiving 
(<B>SO_RCVLOWAT</B>).

These two values are initialised to 1.
<B>SO_SNDLOWAT</B>

is not changeable on Linux 
(<B>setsockopt</B>

fails with the error
<B>ENOPROTOOPT</B>).

<B>SO_RCVLOWAT</B>

is changeable
only since Linux 2.4.
The
<B><A HREF="../man2/select.2.html">select</A></B>(2)

and
<B><A HREF="../man2/poll.2.html">poll</A></B>(2)

system calls currently do not respect the
<B>SO_RCVLOWAT</B>

setting on Linux,
and mark a socket readable when even a single byte of data is available.
A subsequent read from the socket will block until 
<B>SO_RCVLOWAT</B>

bytes are available.


<DT><B>SO_RCVTIMEO</B> and <B>SO_SNDTIMEO</B>

<DD>



Specify the receiving or sending timeouts until reporting an error.
The parameter is a
<I>struct timeval</I>.

If an input or output function blocks for this period of time, and
data has been sent or received, the return value of that function
will be the amount of data transferred; if no data has been transferred
and the timeout has been reached then -1 is returned with
<I>errno</I>

set to EAGAIN or EWOULDBLOCK

just as if the socket was specified to be nonblocking.
If the timeout is set to zero (the default)
then the operation will never timeout.
<DT><B>SO_REUSEADDR</B>

<DD>
Indicates that the rules used in validating addresses supplied in a 
<B><A HREF="../man2/bind.2.html">bind</A></B>(2)

call should allow reuse of local addresses. For
<B>PF_INET</B>

sockets this
means that a socket may bind, except when there
is an active listening socket bound to the address.
When the listening socket is bound to
<B>INADDR_ANY</B>

with a specific port then it is not possible
to bind to this port for any local address.
<DT><B>SO_SNDBUF </B>

<DD>
Sets or gets the maximum socket send buffer in bytes.  
The kernel doubles this value (to allow space for bookkeeping overhead) 
when it is set using

<B>setsockopt</B>(),

and this doubled value is returned by
<B>getsockopt</B>().

The default value is set by the 
<B>wmem_default </B>

sysctl and the maximum allowed value is set by the 
<B>wmem_max</B>

sysctl.   
The minimum (doubled) value for this option is 2048.
<DT><B>SO_SNDBUFFORCE</B> (since Linux 2.6.14)

<DD>
Using this socket option, a privileged
(<B>CAP_NET_ADMIN</B>)

process can perform the same task as 
<B>SO_SNDBUF</B>,

but the 
<B>wmem_max</B>

limit can be overridden.
<DT><B>SO_TIMESTAMP</B>

<DD>
Enable or disable the receiving of the
<B>SO_TIMESTAMP</B>

control message.  
The timestamp control message is sent with level
<B>SOL_SOCKET</B>

and the 
<I>cmsg_data </I>

field is a 
<I>struct timeval</I>

indicating the
reception time of the last packet passed to the user in this call.
See
<B><A HREF="../man3/cmsg.3.html">cmsg</A></B>(3)

for details on control messages.
<DT><B>SO_TYPE</B>

<DD>
Gets the socket type as an integer (like 
<B>SOCK_STREAM</B>).

Can only be read
with 
<B>getsockopt</B>().

</DL>
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SIGNALS</H2>

When writing onto a connection-oriented socket that has been shut down
(by the local or the remote end) 
<B>SIGPIPE</B>

is sent to the writing process and 
<B>EPIPE</B>

is returned. 
The signal is not sent when the write call
specified the
<B>MSG_NOSIGNAL </B>

flag.
<P>

When requested with the 
<B>FIOSETOWN </B>

<B>fcntl</B>()

or 
<B>SIOCSPGRP </B>

<B>ioctl</B>(),

<B>SIGIO </B>

is sent when an I/O event occurs. It is possible to use
<B><A HREF="../man2/poll.2.html">poll</A></B>(2)

or 
<B><A HREF="../man2/select.2.html">select</A></B>(2)

in the signal handler to find out which socket the event occurred on.
An alternative (in Linux 2.2) is to set a realtime signal using the
<B>F_SETSIG</B>

<B>fcntl</B>();

the handler of the real time signal will be called with
the file descriptor in the
<I>si_fd</I>

field of its 
<I>siginfo_t</I>.

See 
<B><A HREF="../man2/fcntl.2.html">fcntl</A></B>(2)

for more information.
<P>

Under some circumstances (e.g. multiple processes accessing a 
single socket), the condition that caused the
<B>SIGIO</B>

may have already disappeared when the process reacts to the signal.
If this happens, the process should wait again because Linux 
will resend the signal later.

<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYSCTLS</H2>

The core socket networking sysctls can be accessed using the 
<I>/proc/sys/net/core/* </I>

files or with the 
<B><A HREF="../man2/sysctl.2.html">sysctl</A></B>(2)

interface. 
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>rmem_default</B>

<DD>
contains the default setting in bytes of the socket receive buffer.
<DT><B>rmem_max</B>

<DD>
contains the maximum socket receive buffer size in bytes which a user may
set by using the 
<B>SO_RCVBUF</B>

socket option. 
<DT><B>wmem_default</B>

<DD>
contains the default setting in bytes of the socket send buffer.
<DT><B>wmem_max</B>

<DD>
contains the maximum socket send buffer size in bytes which a user may
set by using the 
<B>SO_SNDBUF</B>

socket option.

<DT><B>optmem_max</B>

<DD>
Maximum length of ancillary data and user control data like the iovecs 
per socket.  

</DL>
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>IOCTLS</H2>

These operations can be accessed using 
<B><A HREF="../man2/ioctl.2.html">ioctl</A></B>(2):

<P>

<PRE>
<I>error</I><B> = ioctl(</B><I>ip_socket</I><B>, </B><I>ioctl_type</I><B>, </B><I>&amp;value_result</I><B>);</B>

<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>SIOCGSTAMP</B>

<DD>
Return a 
<I>struct timeval </I>

with the receive timestamp of the last packet passed to the user. 
This is useful for accurate round trip time measurements. 
See 
<B><A HREF="../man2/setitimer.2.html">setitimer</A></B>(2)

for a description of 
<I>struct timeval</I>.


This ioctl should only be used if the socket option
<B>SO_TIMESTAMP</B>

is not set on the socket.  
Otherwise, it returns the timestamp of the
last packet that was received while
<B>SO_TIMESTAMP</B>

was not set, or it fails if no such packet has been received,
(i.e., 
<B>ioctl</B>()

returns -1 with 
<I>errno </I>

set to 
<B>ENOENT</B>).

<DT><B>SIOCSPGRP</B>

<DD>
Set the process or process group to send 
<B>SIGIO</B>

or 
<B>SIGURG</B>

signals 
to when an
asynchronous I/O operation has finished or urgent data is available.
The argument is a pointer to a 
<B>pid_t</B>.

If the argument is positive, send the signals to that process.  If the
argument is negative, send the signals to the process group with the ID
of the absolute value of the argument.
The process may only choose itself or its own process group to receive
signals unless it has the
<B>CAP_KILL</B>

capability or an effective UID of 0.
<DT><B>FIOASYNC</B>

<DD>
Change the
<B>O_ASYNC</B>

flag to enable or disable asynchronous I/O mode of the socket. 
Asynchronous I/O mode means that the
<B>SIGIO </B>

signal or the signal set with 
<B>F_SETSIG</B>

is raised when a new I/O event occurs.
<DT><DD>
Argument is an integer boolean flag. 

<DT><B>SIOCGPGRP</B>

<DD>
Get the current process or process group that receives

<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NOTES</H2>

Linux assumes that half of the send/receive buffer is used for internal
kernel structures; thus the sysctls are twice what can be observed
on the wire.
<P>
Linux will only allow port re-use with the SO_REUSEADDR option
when this option was set both in the previous program that performed a 
<B>bind</B>()

to the port and in the program that wants to re-use the port.
This differs from some implementations (e.g., FreeBSD)
where only the later program needs to set the SO_REUSEADDR option.
Typically this difference is invisible, since, for example, a server
program is designed to always set this option.
<A NAME="lbAK">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>BUGS</H2>

The 
<B>CONFIG_FILTER </B>

socket options 
<B>SO_ATTACH_FILTER </B>

and 
<B>SO_DETACH_FILTER </B>

are 
not documented. The suggested interface to use them is via the libpcap
library.
<A NAME="lbAL">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>VERSIONS</H2>

<B>SO_BINDTODEVICE </B>

was introduced in Linux 2.0.30. 
<B>SO_PASSCRED </B>

is new in Linux 2.2.
The sysctls are new in Linux 2.2.
<B>SO_RCVTIMEO</B>

and
<B>SO_SNDTIMEO</B>

are supported since Linux 2.3.41. Earlier, timeouts were fixed to
a protocol specific setting, and could not be read or written.
