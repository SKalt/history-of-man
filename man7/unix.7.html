<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The
<B>AF_UNIX</B>

(also known as
<B>AF_LOCAL</B>)

socket family is used to communicate between processes on the same machine
efficiently.
Traditionally, UNIX domain sockets can be either unnamed,
or bound to a filesystem pathname (marked as being of type socket).
Linux also supports an abstract namespace which is independent of the
filesystem.
<P>
Valid socket types in the UNIX domain are:
<B>SOCK_STREAM</B>,

for a stream-oriented socket;
<B>SOCK_DGRAM</B>,

for a datagram-oriented socket that preserves message boundaries
(as on most UNIX implementations, UNIX domain datagram
sockets are always reliable and don't reorder datagrams);
and (since Linux 2.6.4)
<B>SOCK_SEQPACKET</B>,

for a connection-oriented socket that preserves message boundaries
and delivers messages in the order that they were sent.
<P>
UNIX domain sockets support passing file descriptors or process credentials
to other processes using ancillary data.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Address format</H3>

A UNIX domain socket address is represented in the following structure:

<PRE>

#define UNIX_PATH_MAX    108

struct sockaddr_un {
    sa_family_t sun_family;               /* AF_UNIX */
    char        sun_path[UNIX_PATH_MAX];  /* pathname */
};
</PRE>


<P>

The
<I>sun_family</I>

field always contains
<B>AF_UNIX</B>.

<P>
Various systems calls (for example,
<B><A HREF="../man2/bind.2.html">bind</A></B>(2),

<B><A HREF="../man2/connect.2.html">connect</A></B>(2),

and
<B><A HREF="../man2/sendto.2.html">sendto</A></B>(2))

take a
<I>sockaddr_un</I>

argument as input.
Some other system calls (for example,
<B><A HREF="../man2/getsockname.2.html">getsockname</A></B>(2),

<B><A HREF="../man2/getpeername.2.html">getpeername</A></B>(2),

<B><A HREF="../man2/recvfrom.2.html">recvfrom</A></B>(2),

and
<B><A HREF="../man2/accept.2.html">accept</A></B>(2))

return an argument of this type.
<P>
Three types of address are distinguished in the
<I>sockaddr_un</I>

structure:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
<I>pathname</I>:

a UNIX domain socket can be bound to a null-terminated
filesystem pathname using
<B><A HREF="../man2/bind.2.html">bind</A></B>(2).

When the address of a pathname socket is returned
(by one of the system calls noted above),
its length is
<P>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;offsetof(struct&nbsp;sockaddr_un,&nbsp;sun_path)&nbsp;+&nbsp;strlen(sun_path)&nbsp;+&nbsp;1
<P>
and
<I>sun_path</I>

contains the null-terminated pathname.
(On Linux, the above
<B>offsetof</B>()

expression equates to the same value as
<I>sizeof(sa_family_t)</I>,

but some other implementations include other fields before
<I>sun_path</I>,

so the
<B>offsetof</B>()

expression more portably describes the size of the address structure.)
<DT><DD>
For further details of pathname sockets, see below.
<DT>*<DD>
<I>unnamed</I>:

A stream socket that has not been bound to a pathname using
<B><A HREF="../man2/bind.2.html">bind</A></B>(2)

has no name.
Likewise, the two sockets created by
<B><A HREF="../man2/socketpair.2.html">socketpair</A></B>(2)

are unnamed.
When the address of an unnamed socket is returned,
its length is
<I>sizeof(sa_family_t)</I>,

and
<I>sun_path</I>

should not be inspected.


<DT>*<DD>
<I>abstract</I>:

an abstract socket address is distinguished (from a pathname socket)
by the fact that
<I>sun_path[0]</I>

is a null byte ('\0').
The socket's address in this namespace is given by the additional
bytes in
<I>sun_path</I>

that are covered by the specified length of the address structure.
(Null bytes in the name have no special significance.)
The name has no connection with filesystem pathnames.
When the address of an abstract socket is returned,
the returned
<I>addrlen</I>

is greater than
<I>sizeof(sa_family_t)</I>

(i.e., greater than 2), and the name of the socket is contained in
the first
<I>(addrlen - sizeof(sa_family_t))</I>

bytes of
<I>sun_path</I>.

The abstract socket namespace is a nonportable Linux extension.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Pathname sockets</H3>

When binding a socket to a pathname, a few rules should be observed
for maximum portability and ease of coding:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
The pathname in
<I>sun_path</I>

should be null-terminated.
<DT>*<DD>
The length of the pathname, including the terminating null byte,
should not exceed the size of
<I>sun_path</I>.

<DT>*<DD>
The
<I>addrlen</I>

argument that describes the enclosing
<I>sockaddr_un</I>

structure should have a value of at least:
<P>
<PRE>
    offsetof(struct sockaddr_un, sun_path)+strlen(addr.sun_path)+1
</PRE>

<DT><DD>
or, more simply,
<I>addrlen</I>

can be specified as
<I>sizeof(struct sockaddr_un)</I>.

</DL>
<P>

There is some variation in how implementations handle UNIX domain
socket addresses that do not follow the above rules.
For example, some (but not all) implementations


append a null terminator if none is present in the supplied
<I>sun_path</I>.

<P>
When coding portable applications,
keep in mind that some implementations

have
<I>sun_path</I>

as short as 92 bytes.


<P>
Various system calls
(<B><A HREF="../man2/accept.2.html">accept</A></B>(2),

<B><A HREF="../man2/recvfrom.2.html">recvfrom</A></B>(2),

<B><A HREF="../man2/getsockname.2.html">getsockname</A></B>(2),

<B><A HREF="../man2/getpeername.2.html">getpeername</A></B>(2))

return socket address structures.
When applied to UNIX domain sockets, the value-result
<I>addrlen</I>

argument supplied to the call should be initialized as above.
Upon return, the argument is set to indicate the
<I>actual</I>

size of the address structure.
The caller should check the value returned in this argument:
if the output value exceeds the input value,
then there is no guarantee that a null terminator is present in
<I>sun_path</I>.

(See BUGS.)
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Socket options</H3>

For historical reasons, these socket options are specified with a
<B>SOL_SOCKET</B>

type even though they are
<B>AF_UNIX</B>

specific.
They can be set with
<B><A HREF="../man2/setsockopt.2.html">setsockopt</A></B>(2)

and read with
<B><A HREF="../man2/getsockopt.2.html">getsockopt</A></B>(2)

by specifying
<B>SOL_SOCKET</B>

as the socket family.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>SO_PASSCRED</B>

<DD>
Enables the receiving of the credentials of the sending process in an
ancillary message.
When this option is set and the socket is not yet connected
a unique name in the abstract namespace will be generated automatically.
Expects an integer boolean flag.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Autobind feature</H3>

If a
<B><A HREF="../man2/bind.2.html">bind</A></B>(2)

call specifies
<I>addrlen</I>

as
<I>sizeof(sa_family_t)</I>,


or the
<B>SO_PASSCRED</B>

socket option was specified for a socket that was
not explicitly bound to an address,
then the socket is autobound to an abstract address.
The address consists of a null byte
followed by 5 bytes in the character set
<I>[0-9a-f]</I>.

Thus, there is a limit of 2^20 autobind addresses.
(From Linux 2.1.15, when the autobind feature was added,
8 bytes were used, and the limit was thus 2^32 autobind addresses.
The change to 5 bytes came in Linux 2.3.15.)
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Sockets API</H3>

The following paragraphs describe domain-specific details and
unsupported features of the sockets API for UNIX domain sockets on Linux.
<P>
UNIX domain sockets do not support the transmission of
out-of-band data (the
<B>MSG_OOB</B>

flag for
<B><A HREF="../man2/send.2.html">send</A></B>(2)

and
<B><A HREF="../man2/recv.2.html">recv</A></B>(2)).

<P>
The
<B><A HREF="../man2/send.2.html">send</A></B>(2)

<B>MSG_MORE</B>

flag is not supported by UNIX domain sockets.
<P>
The use of
<B>MSG_TRUNC</B>

in the
<I>flags</I>

argument of
<B><A HREF="../man2/recv.2.html">recv</A></B>(2)

is not supported by UNIX domain sockets.
<P>
The
<B>SO_SNDBUF</B>

socket option does have an effect for UNIX domain sockets, but the
<B>SO_RCVBUF</B>

option does not.
For datagram sockets, the
<B>SO_SNDBUF</B>

value imposes an upper limit on the size of outgoing datagrams.
This limit is calculated as the doubled (see
<B><A HREF="../man7/socket.7.html">socket</A></B>(7))

option value less 32 bytes used for overhead.
<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Ancillary messages</H3>

Ancillary data is sent and received using
<B><A HREF="../man2/sendmsg.2.html">sendmsg</A></B>(2)

and
<B><A HREF="../man2/recvmsg.2.html">recvmsg</A></B>(2).

For historical reasons the ancillary message types listed below
are specified with a
<B>SOL_SOCKET</B>

type even though they are
<B>AF_UNIX</B>

specific.
To send them set the
<I>cmsg_level</I>

field of the struct
<I>cmsghdr</I>

to
<B>SOL_SOCKET</B>

and the
<I>cmsg_type</I>

field to the type.
For more information see
<B><A HREF="../man3/cmsg.3.html">cmsg</A></B>(3).

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>SCM_RIGHTS</B>

<DD>
Send or receive a set of open file descriptors from another process.
The data portion contains an integer array of the file descriptors.
The passed file descriptors behave as though they have been created with
<B><A HREF="../man2/dup.2.html">dup</A></B>(2).

<DT><B>SCM_CREDENTIALS</B>

<DD>
Send or receive UNIX credentials.
This can be used for authentication.
The credentials are passed as a
<I>struct ucred</I>

ancillary message.
Thus structure is defined in
<I>&lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/sys/socket.h">sys/socket.h</A>&gt;</I>

as follows:
<P>

<PRE>
struct ucred {
    pid_t pid;    /* process ID of the sending process */
    uid_t uid;    /* user ID of the sending process */
    gid_t gid;    /* group ID of the sending process */
};
</PRE>


<P>
Since glibc 2.8, the
<B>_GNU_SOURCE</B>

feature test macro must be defined (before including
<I>any</I>

header files) in order to obtain the definition
of this structure.
<P>
The credentials which the sender specifies are checked by the kernel.
A process with effective user ID 0 is allowed to specify values that do
not match its own.
The sender must specify its own process ID (unless it has the capability
<B>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</B>),

its user ID, effective user ID, or saved set-user-ID (unless it has
<B>CAP_SETUID</B>),

and its group ID, effective group ID, or saved set-group-ID
(unless it has
<B>CAP_SETGID</B>).

To receive a
<I>struct ucred</I>

message the
<B>SO_PASSCRED</B>

option must be enabled on the socket.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAK">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Ioctls</H3>

The following
<B><A HREF="../man2/ioctl.2.html">ioctl</A></B>(2)

calls return information in
<I>value</I>.

The correct syntax is:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>int</B><I> value;</I>
<I>error</I><B> = ioctl(</B><I>unix_socket</I><B>, </B><I>ioctl_type</I><B>, &amp;</B><I>value</I><B>);</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

<I>ioctl_type</I>

can be:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>SIOCINQ</B>

<DD>
For
<B>SOCK_STREAM</B>

socket the function returns the amount of queued unread data in the receive buffer.
The socket must not be in LISTEN state, otherwise an error
(<B>EINVAL</B>)

is returned.
<B>SIOCINQ</B>

is defined in
<I>&lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/linux/sockios.h">linux/sockios.h</A>&gt;</I>.



Alternatively,
you can use the synonymous
<B>FIONREAD</B>,

defined in
<I>&lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/sys/ioctl.h">sys/ioctl.h</A>&gt;</I>.







For
<B>SOCK_DGRAM</B>

socket,
the returned value is the same as
for Internet domain datagram socket;
see
<B><A HREF="../man7/udp.7.html">udp</A></B>(7).

</DL>
<A NAME="lbAL">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EADDRINUSE</B>

<DD>
The specified local address is already in use or the filesystem socket
object already exists.
<DT><B>ECONNREFUSED</B>

<DD>
The remote address specified by
<B><A HREF="../man2/connect.2.html">connect</A></B>(2)

was not a listening socket.
This error can also occur if the target pathname is not a socket.
<DT><B>ECONNRESET</B>

<DD>
Remote socket was unexpectedly closed.
<DT><B>EFAULT</B>

<DD>
User memory address was not valid.
<DT><B>EINVAL</B>

<DD>
Invalid argument passed.
A common cause is that the value
<B>AF_UNIX</B>

was not specified in the
<I>sun_type</I>

field of passed addresses, or the socket was in an
invalid state for the applied operation.
<DT><B>EISCONN</B>

<DD>
<B><A HREF="../man2/connect.2.html">connect</A></B>(2)

called on an already connected socket or a target address was
specified on a connected socket.
<DT><B>ENOENT</B>

<DD>
The pathname in the remote address specified to
<B><A HREF="../man2/connect.2.html">connect</A></B>(2)

did not exist.
<DT><B>ENOMEM</B>

<DD>
Out of memory.
<DT><B>ENOTCONN</B>

<DD>
Socket operation needs a target address, but the socket is not connected.
<DT><B>EOPNOTSUPP</B>

<DD>
Stream operation called on non-stream oriented socket or tried to
use the out-of-band data option.
<DT><B>EPERM</B>

<DD>
The sender passed invalid credentials in the
<I>struct ucred</I>.

<DT><B>EPIPE</B>

<DD>
Remote socket was closed on a stream socket.
If enabled, a
<B>SIGPIPE</B>

is sent as well.
This can be avoided by passing the
<B>MSG_NOSIGNAL</B>

flag to
<B><A HREF="../man2/sendmsg.2.html">sendmsg</A></B>(2)

or
<B><A HREF="../man2/recvmsg.2.html">recvmsg</A></B>(2).

<DT><B>EPROTONOSUPPORT</B>

<DD>
Passed protocol is not
<B>AF_UNIX</B>.

<DT><B>EPROTOTYPE</B>

<DD>
Remote socket does not match the local socket type
(<B>SOCK_DGRAM</B>

versus
<B>SOCK_STREAM</B>)

<DT><B>ESOCKTNOSUPPORT</B>

<DD>
Unknown socket type.
</DL>
<P>

Other errors can be generated by the generic socket layer or
by the filesystem while generating a filesystem socket object.
See the appropriate manual pages for more information.
<A NAME="lbAM">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>VERSIONS</H2>

<B>SCM_CREDENTIALS</B>

and the abstract namespace were introduced with Linux 2.2 and should not
be used in portable programs.
(Some BSD-derived systems also support credential passing,
but the implementation details differ.)
<A NAME="lbAN">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NOTES</H2>

In the Linux implementation, sockets which are visible in the
filesystem honor the permissions of the directory they are in.
Their owner, group, and permissions can be changed.
Creation of a new socket will fail if the process does not have write and
search (execute) permission on the directory the socket is created in.
Connecting to the socket object requires read/write permission.
This behavior differs from many BSD-derived systems which
ignore permissions for UNIX domain sockets.
Portable programs should not rely on
this feature for security.
<P>
Binding to a socket with a filename creates a socket
in the filesystem that must be deleted by the caller when it is no
longer needed (using
<B><A HREF="../man2/unlink.2.html">unlink</A></B>(2)).

The usual UNIX close-behind semantics apply; the socket can be unlinked
at any time and will be finally removed from the filesystem when the last
reference to it is closed.
<P>
To pass file descriptors or credentials over a
<B>SOCK_STREAM</B>,

you need
to send or receive at least one byte of nonancillary data in the same
<B><A HREF="../man2/sendmsg.2.html">sendmsg</A></B>(2)

or
<B><A HREF="../man2/recvmsg.2.html">recvmsg</A></B>(2)

call.
<P>
UNIX domain stream sockets do not support the notion of out-of-band data.

<A NAME="lbAO">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>BUGS</H2>

When binding a socket to an address,
Linux is one of the implementations that appends a null terminator
if none is supplied in
<I>sun_path</I>.

In most cases this is unproblematic:
when the socket address is retrieved,
it will be one byte longer than that supplied when the socket was bound.
However, there is one case where confusing behavior can result:
if 108 non-null bytes are supplied when a socket is bound,
then the addition of the null terminator takes the length of
the pathname beyond
<I>sizeof(sun_path)</I>.

Consequently, when retrieving the socket address
(for example, via
<B><A HREF="../man2/accept.2.html">accept</A></B>(2)),


if the input
<I>addrlen</I>

argument for the retrieving call is specified as
<I>sizeof(struct sockaddr_un)</I>,

then the returned address structure
<I>won't</I>

have a null terminator in
<I>sun_path</I>.

<P>
In addition, some implementations

don't require a null terminator when binding a socket (the
<I>addrlen</I>

argument is used to determine the length of
<I>sun_path</I>)

and when the socket address is retrieved on these implementations,
there is no null terminator in
<I>sun_path</I>.

<P>
Applications that retrieve socket addresses can (portably) code
to handle the possibility that there is no null terminator in
<I>sun_path</I>

by respecting the fact that the number of valid bytes in the pathname is:
<P>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;strnlen(addr.sun_path,&nbsp;addrlen&nbsp;-&nbsp;offsetof(sockaddr_un,&nbsp;sun_path))










<P>
Alternatively, an application can retrieve
the socket address by allocating a buffer of size
<I>sizeof(struct sockaddr_un)+1</I>

that is zeroed out before the retrieval.
The retrieving call can specify
<I>addrlen</I>

as
<I>sizeof(struct sockaddr_un)</I>,

and the extra zero byte ensures that there will be
a null terminator for the string returned in
<I>sun_path</I>:

<P>
<PRE>
void *addrp;

addrlen = sizeof(struct sockaddr_un);
addrp = malloc(addrlen + 1);
if (addrp == NULL)
    /* Handle error */ ;
memset(addrp, 0, addrlen + 1);

if (getsockname(sfd, (struct sockaddr *) addrp, &amp;addrlen)) == -1)
    /* handle error */ ;

printf(&quot;sun_path = %s\n&quot;, ((struct sockaddr_un *) addrp)-&gt;sun_path);
</PRE>

<P>
This sort of messiness can be avoided if it is guaranteed
that the applications that
<I>create</I>

pathname sockets follow the rules outlined above under
<I>Pathname sockets</I>.
