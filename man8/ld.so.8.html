<A NAME="lbAB">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NAME</H2>

ld.so, ld-linux.so* - dynamic linker/loader
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

The dynamic linker can be run either indirectly by running some
dynamically linked program or library (in which case no command-line options
to the dynamic linker can be passed and, in the ELF case, the dynamic linker
which is stored in the
<B>.interp</B>

section of the program is executed) or directly by running:
<P>

<I>/lib/ld-linux.so.*</I>

[OPTIONS] [PROGRAM [ARGUMENTS]]
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The programs
<B>ld.so</B>

and
<B>ld-linux.so*</B>

find and load the shared libraries needed by a program, prepare
the program to run, and then run it.
<P>

Linux binaries require dynamic linking (linking at run time)
unless the
<B>-static</B>

option was given to
<B><A HREF="../man1/ld.1.html">ld</A></B>(1)

during compilation.
<P>

The program
<B>ld.so</B>

handles a.out binaries, a format used long ago;
<B>ld-linux.so*</B>

handles ELF (<I>/lib/ld-linux.so.1</I> for libc5, <I>/lib/ld-linux.so.2</I>
for glibc2), which everybody has been using for years now.
Otherwise both have the same behavior, and use the same
support files and programs
<B><A HREF="../man1/ldd.1.html">ldd</A></B>(1),

<B><A HREF="../man8/ldconfig.8.html">ldconfig</A></B>(8)

and
<I>/etc/ld.so.conf</I>.

<P>

The shared libraries needed by the program are searched for
in the following order:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>o<DD>
(ELF only) Using the directories specified in the
DT_RPATH dynamic section attribute
of the binary if present and DT_RUNPATH attribute does not exist.
Use of DT_RPATH is deprecated.
<DT>o<DD>
Using the environment variable
<B>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</B>.

Except if the executable is a set-user-ID/set-group-ID binary,
in which case it is ignored.
<DT>o<DD>
(ELF only) Using the directories specified in the
DT_RUNPATH dynamic section attribute
of the binary if present.
<DT>o<DD>
From the cache file
<I>/etc/ld.so.cache</I>

which contains a compiled list of candidate libraries previously found
in the augmented library path.
If, however, the binary was linked with the
<B>-z nodeflib</B>

linker option, libraries in the default library paths are skipped.
<DT>o<DD>
In the default path
<I>/lib</I>,

and then
<I>/usr/lib</I>.

If the binary was linked with the
<B>-z nodeflib</B>

linker option, this step is skipped.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>$ORIGIN and rpath</H3>

<P>

<B>ld.so</B>

understands the string
<I>$ORIGIN</I>

(or equivalently
<I>${ORIGIN}</I>)

in an rpath specification (DT_RPATH or DT_RUNPATH) to mean
the directory containing the application executable.
Thus, an application located in
<I>somedir/app</I>

could be compiled with
<I>gcc -Wl,-rpath,'$ORIGIN/../lib'</I>

so that it finds an associated shared library in
<I>somedir/lib</I>

no matter where
<I>somedir</I>

is located in the directory hierarchy.
This facilitates the creation of &quot;turn-key&quot; applications that
do not need to be installed into special directories,
but can instead be unpacked into any directory
and still find their own shared libraries.













<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>--list</B>

<DD>
List all dependencies and how they are resolved.
<DT><B>--verify</B>

<DD>
Verify that program is dynamically linked and this dynamic linker can handle
it.
<DT><B>--library-path PATH</B>

<DD>
Use PATH instead of
<B>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</B>

environment variable setting (see below).
<DT><B>--inhibit-rpath LIST</B>

<DD>
Ignore RPATH and RUNPATH information in object names in LIST.
This option is ignored if
<B>ld.so</B>

is set-user-ID or set-group-ID.
<DT><B>--audit LIST</B>

<DD>
Use objects named in LIST as auditors.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ENVIRONMENT</H2>

There are four important environment variables.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>LD_BIND_NOW</B>

<DD>
(libc5; glibc since 2.1.1)
If set to a nonempty string,
causes the dynamic linker to resolve all symbols
at program startup instead of deferring function call resolution to the point
when they are first referenced.
This is useful when using a debugger.
<DT><B>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</B>

<DD>
A colon-separated list of directories in which to search for
ELF libraries at execution-time.
Similar to the
<B>PATH</B>

environment variable.
<DT><B>LD_PRELOAD</B>

<DD>
A whitespace-separated list of additional, user-specified, ELF shared
libraries to be loaded before all others.
This can be used to selectively override functions in other shared libraries.
For set-user-ID/set-group-ID ELF binaries,
only libraries in the standard search
directories that are also set-user-ID will be loaded.
<DT><B>LD_TRACE_LOADED_OBJECTS</B>

<DD>
(ELF only)
If set to a nonempty string, causes the program to list its dynamic library
dependencies, as if run by
<B><A HREF="../man1/ldd.1.html">ldd</A></B>(1),

instead of running normally.
</DL>
<P>

Then there are lots of more or less obscure variables,
many obsolete or only for internal use.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>LD_AOUT_LIBRARY_PATH</B>

<DD>
(libc5)
Version of
<B>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</B>

for a.out binaries only.
Old versions of ld-linux.so.1 also supported
<B>LD_ELF_LIBRARY_PATH</B>.

<DT><B>LD_AOUT_PRELOAD</B>

<DD>
(libc5)
Version of
<B>LD_PRELOAD</B>

for a.out binaries only.
Old versions of ld-linux.so.1 also supported
<B>LD_ELF_PRELOAD</B>.

<DT><B>LD_AUDIT</B>

<DD>
(glibc since 2.4)
A colon-separated list of user-specified, ELF shared objects
to be loaded before all others in a separate linker namespace
(i.e., one that does not intrude upon the normal symbol bindings that
would occur in the process).
These libraries can be used to audit the operation of the dynamic linker.
<B>LD_AUDIT</B>

is ignored for set-user-ID/set-group-ID binaries.
<P>
The dynamic linker will notify the audit
libraries at so-called auditing checkpoints---for example,
loading a new library, resolving a symbol,
or calling a symbol from another shared object---by
calling an appropriate function within the audit library.
For details, see
<B><A HREF="../man7/rtld-audit.7.html">rtld-audit</A></B>(7).

The auditing interface is largely compatible with that provided on Solaris,
as described in its
<I>Linker and Libraries Guide</I>,

in the chapter
<I>Runtime Linker Auditing Interface</I>.

<DT><B>LD_BIND_NOT</B>

<DD>
(glibc since 2.1.95)
Do not update the GOT (global offset table) and PLT (procedure linkage table)
after resolving a symbol.
<DT><B>LD_DEBUG</B>

<DD>
(glibc since 2.1)
Output verbose debugging information about the dynamic linker.
If set to
<B>all</B>

prints all debugging information it has, if set to
<B>help</B>

prints a help message about which categories can be specified in this
environment variable.
Since glibc 2.3.4,
<B>LD_DEBUG</B>

is ignored for set-user-ID/set-group-ID binaries.
<DT><B>LD_DEBUG_OUTPUT</B>

<DD>
(glibc since 2.1)
File where
<B>LD_DEBUG</B>

output should be fed into, default is standard output.
<B>LD_DEBUG_OUTPUT</B>

is ignored for set-user-ID/set-group-ID binaries.
<DT><B>LD_DYNAMIC_WEAK</B>

<DD>
(glibc since 2.1.91)
Allow weak symbols to be overridden (reverting to old glibc behavior).
For security reasons, since glibc 2.3.4,
<B>LD_DYNAMIC_WEAK</B>

is ignored for set-user-ID/set-group-ID binaries.
<DT><B>LD_HWCAP_MASK</B>

<DD>
(glibc since 2.1)
Mask for hardware capabilities.
<DT><B>LD_KEEPDIR</B>

<DD>
(a.out only)(libc5)
Don't ignore the directory in the names of a.out libraries to be loaded.
Use of this option is strongly discouraged.
<DT><B>LD_NOWARN</B>

<DD>
(a.out only)(libc5)
Suppress warnings about a.out libraries with incompatible minor
version numbers.
<DT><B>LD_ORIGIN_PATH</B>

<DD>
(glibc since 2.1)
Path where the binary is found (for non-set-user-ID programs).
For security reasons, since glibc 2.4,
<B>LD_ORIGIN_PATH</B>

is ignored for set-user-ID/set-group-ID binaries.


<DT><B>LD_POINTER_GUARD</B>

<DD>
(glibc since 2.4)
Set to 0 to disable pointer guarding.
Any other value enables pointer guarding, which is also the default.
Pointer guarding is a security mechanism whereby some pointers to code
stored in writable program memory (return addresses saved by
<B><A HREF="../man3/setjmp.3.html">setjmp</A></B>(3)

or function pointers used by various glibc internals) are mangled
semi-randomly to make it more difficult for an attacker to hijack
the pointers for use in the event of a buffer overrun or
stack-smashing attack.
<DT><B>LD_PROFILE</B>

<DD>
(glibc since 2.1)
Shared object to be profiled,
specified either as a pathname or a soname.
Profiling output is written to the file whose name is:
&quot;<I>$LD_PROFILE_OUTPUT</I>/<I>$LD_PROFILE</I>.profile&quot;.
<DT><B>LD_PROFILE_OUTPUT</B>

<DD>
(glibc since 2.1)
Directory where
<B>LD_PROFILE</B>

output should be written.
If this variable is not defined, or is defined as an empty string,
then the default is
<I>/var/tmp</I>.

<B>LD_PROFILE_OUTPUT</B>

is ignored for set-user-ID and set-group-ID programs,
which always use
<I>/var/profile</I>.

<DT><B>LD_SHOW_AUXV</B>

<DD>
(glibc since 2.1)
Show auxiliary array passed up from the kernel.
For security reasons, since glibc 2.3.5,
<B>LD_SHOW_AUXV</B>

is ignored for set-user-ID/set-group-ID binaries.




<DT><B>LD_USE_LOAD_BIAS</B>

<DD>



By default (i.e., if this variable is not defined)
executables and prelinked
shared objects will honor base addresses of their dependent libraries
and (nonprelinked) position-independent executables (PIEs)
and other shared objects will not honor them.
If
<B>LD_USE_LOAD_BIAS</B>

is defined wit the value, both executables and PIEs
will honor the base addresses.
If
<B>LD_USE_LOAD_BIAS</B>

is defined with the value 0,
neither executables nor PIEs will honor the base addresses.
This variable is ignored by set-user-ID and set-group-ID programs.
<DT><B>LD_VERBOSE</B>

<DD>
(glibc since 2.1)
If set to a nonempty string,
output symbol versioning information about the
program if querying information about the program (i.e., either
<B>LD_TRACE_LOADED_OBJECTS</B>

has been set, or
<B>--list</B>

or
<B>--verify</B>

options have been given to the dynamic linker).
<DT><B>LD_WARN</B>

<DD>
(ELF only)(glibc since 2.1.3)
If set to a nonempty string, warn about unresolved symbols.
<DT><B>LDD_ARGV0</B>

<DD>
(libc5)
<I>argv</I>[0]

to be used by
<B><A HREF="../man1/ldd.1.html">ldd</A></B>(1)

when none is present.
