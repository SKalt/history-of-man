<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>



















The
<B>zic</B>

program reads text from the file(s) named on the command line
and creates the time conversion information files specified in this input.
If a
<I>filename</I>

is

standard input is read.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>--version</B>

<DD>
Output version information and exit.
<DT><B>--help</B>

<DD>
Output short usage message and exit.
<DT><B>-d </B><I>directory</I>

<DD>
Create time conversion information files in the named directory rather than
in the standard directory named below.
<DT><B>-l </B><I>timezone</I>

<DD>
Use
<I>timezone</I>

as local time.
<B>zic</B>

will act as if the input contained a link line of the form

Use
<I>timezone</I>'s

rules when handling POSIX-format
timezone environment variables.

<DT><B>-L </B><I>leapsecondfilename</I>

<DD>
Read leap second information from the file with the given name.
If this option is not used,
no leap second information appears in output files.
<DT><B>-v</B>

<DD>
Be more verbose, and complain about the following situations:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The input specifies a link to a link.
<P>

A year that appears in a data file is outside the range
of years representable by
<B><A HREF="../man2/time.2.html">time</A></B>(2)

values.
<P>

A time of 24:00 or more appears in the input.
Pre-1998 versions of
<B>zic</B>

prohibit 24:00, and pre-2007 versions prohibit times greater than 24:00.
<P>

A rule goes past the start or end of the month.
Pre-2004 versions of
<B>zic</B>

prohibit this.
<P>

The output file does not contain all the information about the
long-term future of a timezone, because the future cannot be summarized as
an extended POSIX TZ string.  For example, as of 2013 this problem
occurs for Iran's daylight-saving rules for the predicted future, as
these rules are based on the Iranian calendar, which cannot be
represented.
<P>

The output contains data that may not be handled properly by client
code designed for older
<B>zic</B>

output formats.  These compatibility issues affect only timestamps
before 1970 or after the start of 2038.
<P>

A time zone abbreviation has fewer than 3 characters.
POSIX requires at least 3.
<P>

An output file name contains a byte that is not an ASCII letter,


or

or it contains a file name component that contains more than 14 bytes
or that starts with

</DL>

<DT><B>-s</B>

<DD>
Limit time values stored in output files to values that are the same
whether they're taken to be signed or unsigned.
You can use this option to generate SVVS-compatible files.
</DL>
<P>

Input files should be text files, that is, they should be a series of
zero or more lines, each ending in a newline byte and containing at
most 511 bytes, and without any NUL bytes.  The input text's encoding
is typically UTF-8 or ASCII; it should have a unibyte representation
for the POSIX Portable Character Set (PPCS)
&lt;<A HREF="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap06.html">http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap06.html</A>&gt;
and the encoding's non-unibyte characters should consist entirely of
non-PPCS bytes.  Non-PPCS characters typically occur only in comments:
although output file names and time zone abbreviations can contain
nearly any character, other software will work better if these are
limited to the restricted syntax described under the
<B>-v</B>

option.
<P>

Input lines are made up of fields.
Fields are separated from one another by one or more white space characters.
The white space characters are space, form feed, carriage return, newline,
tab, and vertical tab.
Leading and trailing white space on input lines is ignored.
An unquoted sharp character (#) in the input introduces a comment which extends
to the end of the line the sharp character appears on.
White space characters and sharp characters may be enclosed in double quotes
(&quot;) if they're to be used as part of a field.
Any line that is blank (after comment stripping) is ignored.
Nonblank lines are expected to be of one of three types:
rule lines, zone lines, and link lines.
<P>

Names must be in English and are case insensitive.
They appear in several contexts, and include month and weekday names
and keywords such as
<B>maximum</B>,

<B>only</B>,

<B>Rolling</B>,

and
<B>Zone</B>.

A name can be abbreviated by omitting all but an initial prefix; any
abbreviation must be unambiguous in context.
<P>

A rule line has the form
<PRE>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Rule  NAME  FROM  TO    TYPE  IN   ON       AT     SAVE   LETTER/S

For example:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Rule  US    1967  1973  -     Apr  lastSun  2:00w  1:00   D

</PRE>

The fields that make up a rule line are:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>NAME</B>

<DD>
Gives the name of the rule set that contains this line.
The name must start with a character that is neither
an ASCII digit nor

nor

To allow for future extensions,
an unquoted name should not contain characters from the set

<DT><B>FROM</B>

<DD>
Gives the first year in which the rule applies.
Any signed integer year can be supplied; the proleptic Gregorian calendar
is assumed, with year 0 preceding year 1.
The word
<B>minimum</B>

(or an abbreviation) means the indefinite past.
The word
<B>maximum</B>

(or an abbreviation) means the indefinite future.
Rules can describe times that are not representable as time values,
with the unrepresentable times ignored; this allows rules to be portable
among hosts with differing time value types.
<DT><B>TO</B>

<DD>
Gives the final year in which the rule applies.
In addition to
<B>minimum</B>

and
<B>maximum</B>

(as above),
the word
<B>only</B>

(or an abbreviation)
may be used to repeat the value of the
<B>FROM</B>

field.
<DT><B>TYPE</B>

<DD>
should be

and is present for compatibility with older versions of
<B>zic</B>

in which it could contain year types.
<DT><B>IN</B>

<DD>
Names the month in which the rule takes effect.
Month names may be abbreviated.
<DT><B>ON</B>

<DD>
Gives the day on which the rule takes effect.
Recognized forms include:
<PRE>


5        the fifth of the month
lastSun  the last Sunday in the month
lastMon  the last Monday in the month
Sun&gt;=8   first Sunday on or after the eighth
Sun&lt;=25  last Sunday on or before the 25th
</PRE>


<P>
A weekday name (e.g.,
<B>Sunday</B>)

or a weekday name preceded by

(e.g.,
<B>lastSunday</B>)

may be abbreviated or spelled out in full.
Note that there must be no spaces within the
<B>ON</B>

field.
<DT><B>AT</B>

<DD>
Gives the time of day at which the rule takes effect.
Recognized forms include:
<PRE>


2            time in hours
2:00         time in hours and minutes
01:28:14     time in hours, minutes, and seconds
15:00        24-hour format time (for times after noon)
260:00       260 hours after 00:00
-2:30        2.5 hours before 00:00
-            equivalent to 0
</PRE>


<P>
where hour 0 is midnight at the start of the day,
and hour 24 is midnight at the end of the day.
Any of these forms may be followed by the letter
<B>w</B>

if the given time is local

time,
<B>s</B>

if the given time is local

time, or
<B>u</B>

(or
<B>g</B>

or
<B>z</B>)

if the given time is universal time;
in the absence of an indicator,
wall clock time is assumed.
The intent is that a rule line describes the instants when a
clock/calendar set to the type of time specified in the
<B>AT</B>

field would show the specified date and time of day.
<DT><B>SAVE</B>

<DD>
Gives the amount of time to be added to local standard time when the rule is in
effect.
This field has the same format as the
<B>AT</B>

field
(although, of course, the
<B>w</B>

and
<B>s</B>

suffixes are not used).
Negative offsets are allowed; in Ireland, for example, daylight saving
time is observed in winter and has a negative offset relative to
Irish Standard Time.
The offset is merely added to standard time; for example,
<B>zic</B>

does not distinguish a 10:30 standard time plus an 0:30
<B>SAVE</B>

from a 10:00 standard time plus a 1:00
<B>SAVE</B>.

<DT><B>LETTER/S</B>

<DD>
Gives the

(for example, the

or

in

or

of time zone abbreviations to be used when this rule is in effect.
If this field is

the variable part is null.
</DL>
<P>

A zone line has the form
<P>
<PRE>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Zone  NAME        UTOFF  RULES   FORMAT  [UNTIL]

For example:

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zone         Asia/Amman     2:00    JordanEE%sT2017 Oct 27 01:00

</PRE>

The fields that make up a zone line are:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>NAME</B>

<DD>
The name of the timezone.
This is the name used in creating the time conversion information file for the
timezone.
It should not contain a file name component

or

a file name component is a maximal substring that does not contain

<DT><B>UTOFF</B>

<DD>
The amount of time to add to UT to get standard time.
This field has the same format as the
<B>AT</B>

and
<B>SAVE</B>

fields of rule lines;
begin the field with a minus sign if time must be subtracted from UT.
<DT><B>RULES</B>

<DD>
The name of the rules that apply in the timezone or,
alternatively, a field in the same format as a rule-line SAVE column,
giving of the amount of time to be added to local standard time
effect, and whether the resulting time is standard or daylight saving.
If this field is
<B>-</B>

then standard time always applies.
When an amount of time is given, only the sum of standard time and
this amount matters.
<DT><B>FORMAT</B>

<DD>
The format for time zone abbreviations.
The pair of characters
<B>%s</B>

is used to show where the

of the time zone abbreviation goes.
Alternatively, a format can use the pair of characters
<B>%z</B>

to stand for the UT offset in the form
&plusmn;<I>hh</I>,

&plusmn;<I>hhmm</I>,

or
&plusmn;<I>hhmmss</I>,

using the shortest form that does not lose information, where
<I>hh</I>,

<I>mm</I>,

and
<I>ss</I>

are the hours, minutes, and seconds east (+) or west (-) of UT.
Alternatively,
a slash (/)
separates standard and daylight abbreviations.
To conform to POSIX, a time zone abbreviation should contain only
alphanumeric ASCII characters,

and

<DT><B>UNTIL</B>

<DD>
The time at which the UT offset or the rule(s) change for a location.
It takes the form of YEAR [MONTH [DAY [TIME]]].
If this is specified,
the time zone information is generated from the given UT offset
and rule change until the time specified, which is interpreted using
the rules in effect just before the transition.
The month, day, and time of day have the same format as the IN, ON, and AT
fields of a rule; trailing fields can be omitted, and default to the
earliest possible value for the missing fields.
<DT><DD>
The next line must be a

line; this has the same form as a zone line except that the
string

and the name are omitted, as the continuation line will
place information starting at the time specified as the

information in the previous line in the file used by the previous line.
Continuation lines may contain

information, just as zone lines do, indicating that the next line is a further
continuation.
</DL>
<P>

If a zone changes at the same instant that a rule would otherwise take
effect in the earlier zone or continuation line, the rule is ignored.
In a single zone it is an error if two rules take effect at the same
instant, or if two zone changes take effect at the same instant.
<P>

A link line has the form
<P>
<PRE>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Link  TARGET           LINK-NAME

For example:

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Link              Europe/IstanbulAsia/Istanbul

</PRE>

The
<B>TARGET</B>

field should appear as the
<B>NAME</B>

field in some zone line.
The
<B>LINK-NAME</B>

field is used as an alternative name for that zone;
it has the same syntax as a zone line's
<B>NAME</B>

field.
<P>

Except for continuation lines,
lines may appear in any order in the input.
However, the behavior is unspecified if multiple zone or link lines
define the same name, or if the source of one link line is the target
of another.
<P>

Lines in the file that describes leap seconds have the following form:
<PRE>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Leap  YEAR  MONTH  DAY  HH:MM:SS  CORR  R/S

For example:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Leap  2016  Dec    31   23:59:60  +     S

</PRE>

The
<B>YEAR</B>,

<B>MONTH</B>,

<B>DAY</B>,

and
<B>HH:MM:SS</B>

fields tell when the leap second happened.
The
<B>CORR</B>

field
should be

if a second was added
or

if a second was skipped.
The
<B>R/S</B>

field
should be (an abbreviation of)

if the leap second time given by the other fields should be interpreted as UTC
or
(an abbreviation of)

if the leap second time given by the other fields should be interpreted as
local wall clock time.

<H2>EXTENDED EXAMPLE</H2>

Here is an extended example of
<B>zic</B>

input, intended to illustrate many of its features.
In this example, the EU rules are for the European Union
and for its predecessor organization, the European Communities.
<BR>


<PRE>


# Rule  NAME  FROM  TO    TYPE  IN   ON       AT    SAVE  LETTER/S

Link    Europe/Zurich  Europe/Vaduz

</PRE>

In this example, the timezone is named Europe/Zurich but it has an alias
as Europe/Vaduz.  This example says that Zurich was 34 minutes and 8
seconds east of UT until 1853-07-16 at 00:00, when the legal offset
was changed to 7&#176;26&#180;22.50sd; although this works out to
0:29:45.50, the input format cannot represent fractional seconds so it
is rounded here.  After 1894-06-01 at 00:00 the UT offset became one hour
and Swiss daylight saving rules (defined with lines beginning with

apply.  From 1981 to the present, EU daylight saving rules have
applied, and the UTC offset has remained at one hour.
<P>

In 1941 and 1942, daylight saving time applied from the first Monday
in May at 01:00 to the first Monday in October at 02:00.
The pre-1981 EU daylight-saving rules have no effect
here, but are included for completeness.  Since 1981, daylight
saving has begun on the last Sunday in March at 01:00 UTC.
Until 1995 it ended the last Sunday in September at 01:00 UTC,
but this changed to the last Sunday in October starting in 1996.
<P>

For purposes of display,

and

were initially used, respectively.  Since
Swiss rules and later EU rules were applied, the time zone abbreviation
has been CET for standard time and CEST for daylight saving
time.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>FILES</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><I>/etc/localtime</I>

<DD>
Default local timezone file.
<DT><I>/usr/share/zoneinfo</I>

<DD>
Default timezone information directory.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NOTES</H2>

For areas with more than two types of local time,
you may need to use local standard time in the
<B>AT</B>

field of the earliest transition time's rule to ensure that
the earliest transition time recorded in the compiled file is correct.
<P>

If,
for a particular timezone,
a clock advance caused by the start of daylight saving
coincides with and is equal to
a clock retreat caused by a change in UT offset,
<B>zic</B>

produces a single transition to daylight saving at the new UT offset
(without any change in wall clock time).
To get separate transitions
use multiple zone continuation lines
specifying transition instants using universal time.
