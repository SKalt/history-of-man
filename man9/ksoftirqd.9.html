ksoftirqd - Softirq daemon
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B>ksoftirqd</B>

is a per-cpu kernel thread that runs when the machine is under heavy
soft-interrupt load.
Soft interrupts are normally serviced on return from
a hard interrupt, but it's possible for soft interrupts to be triggered
more quickly than they can be serviced.
If a soft interrupt is triggered
for a second time while soft interrupts are being handled, the
<B>ksoftirq</B>

daemon is triggered to handle the soft interrupts in process context.
If
<B>ksoftirqd</B>

is taking more than a tiny percentage of CPU time, this indicates the
machine is under heavy soft interrupt load.

<H2>HISTORY</H2>

<B>ksoftirqd</B>

was introduced during the 2.3 development series as part of the
softnet work by Alexey Kuznetsov and David Miller.
